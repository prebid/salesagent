# Flask → FastAPI v2.0.0 Migration — Implementation Checklist

**Status:** SOURCE OF TRUTH for "am I ready to ship Wave N?"
**Target release:** salesagent v2.0.0
**Feature branch:** `feat/v2.0.0-flask-to-fastapi`
**Last updated:** 2026-04-12 (async pivot reversed — v2.0 ships sync)

> **ASYNC PIVOT REVERSED (2026-04-12)**
>
> v2.0 ships with **sync `def` admin handlers** and sync SQLAlchemy. The April 11
> async pivot (Option A) was reversed after cost-benefit analysis showed marginal
> benefit at current scale. Async SQLAlchemy is deferred to v2.1.
>
> **Sections in this file that still contain async language:**
> - §1.2 Decisions 1, 3, 7, 9 — describe async-era work; tagged MOOT or DEFERRED
> - §2 Blocker 4 — describes async conversion; entire section is DEFERRED TO v2.1
> - §4 Wave 4 and Wave 5 — async conversion scope; DEFERRED TO v2.1
> - §3.5 items tagged `[DEFERRED v2.1]` — async-only findings
>
> **For implementation, read `execution-plan.md` (sync, 7 phases).** This checklist
> is for verification tracking.

## How to use this file

> **Implementation agents: START with [`execution-plan.md`](execution-plan.md), NOT this file.**
> The execution plan has 13 phases in strict order, each a standalone briefing with
> everything you need (goal, prereqs, knowledge sources, work items, exit gate).
> This checklist is the **verification/tracking** document — tick boxes here AFTER
> completing work defined in the execution plan.

This checklist consolidates every action item from the companion migration documents into categorized sections. Each checkbox is a prerequisite, blocker fix, action item, wave acceptance criterion, rollback trigger, post-migration verification step, or deferred tech-debt tracking item.

**Relationship between this file and `execution-plan.md`:**
- **`execution-plan.md`** = what to do, in what order (read BEFORE coding)
- **`implementation-checklist.md`** (this file) = verification tracking (tick AFTER completing)
- Items in this file are tagged with `[§X]` references; the execution plan pulls items from ALL sections into phase-ordered work lists

Every item references the companion doc where full detail lives. Tick every box for a given section before declaring that section "done." The deep audit's six BLOCKERS (Section 2) MUST be fixed in Wave 0 — shipping Wave 1 without them will cause silent production breakage.

**Companion docs (all under `.claude/notes/flask-to-fastapi/`):**
- `flask-to-fastapi-migration.md` — main overview (§14 waves, §2.8 blockers)
- `flask-to-fastapi-execution-details.md` — per-wave execution with rollback
- `flask-to-fastapi-foundation-modules.md` — 11 foundation module implementations
- `flask-to-fastapi-worked-examples.md` — 5 real Flask→FastAPI translations
- `flask-to-fastapi-adcp-safety.md` — first-order AdCP boundary audit
- `flask-to-fastapi-deep-audit.md` — 2nd/3rd-order audit (6 blockers + 20 risks)

## Section 1 — Pre-migration prerequisites (run once, before Wave 0)

### 1.1 Environment and infrastructure prerequisites

- [ ] `SESSION_SECRET` env var is set in staging secret store
- [ ] `SESSION_SECRET` env var is set in production secret store
- [ ] `SESSION_SECRET` env var is set in test/CI secret store
- [ ] `DATABASE_URL` env var format compatible with asyncpg driver rewrite (staging + prod + test): `postgresql://...` gets rewritten to `postgresql+asyncpg://...` at engine construction — verified — pivoted 2026-04-11
- [ ] `SESSION_SECRET` documented in `.env.example`
- [ ] `SESSION_SECRET` documented in `docs/deployment/environment-variables.md`
- [ ] OAuth redirect URIs currently registered in Google Cloud Console enumerated and documented in a migration runbook — at minimum:
  - [ ] `https://<tenant>.scope3.com/admin/auth/google/callback`
  - [ ] `https://<tenant>.scope3.com/admin/auth/oidc/callback` (NO `{tenant_id}` in URL — tenant context comes from the session, verified at `src/admin/blueprints/oidc.py:209,215`)
  - [ ] `https://<tenant>.scope3.com/admin/auth/gam/callback` (WITH `/admin` prefix — route registered in `auth.py:959` under `auth_bp` which is mounted at `/admin` via nginx `SCRIPT_NAME`; verified at `src/admin/blueprints/auth.py:931`)
- [ ] External consumer contracts confirmed for Category-2 files:
  - [ ] `src/admin/tenant_management_api.py` (6 routes, `X-Tenant-Management-API-Key`)
  - [ ] `src/admin/sync_api.py` (9 routes, `X-API-Key`, duplicate mount at `/api/sync`)
  - [ ] `src/admin/blueprints/schemas.py` (`/schemas/adcp/v2.4/*`, external JSON Schema validators)
- [ ] Feature branch `feat/v2.0.0-flask-to-fastapi` created from green main
- [ ] Team announcement sent: `src/admin/` freeze will take effect during Wave 2 for ≤ 7 calendar days
- [ ] Rollback window documented for each wave (see Section 5)
- [ ] Staging environment matches production topology:
  - [ ] Fly.io proxy header behavior verified (`X-Forwarded-*` present)
  - [ ] nginx config unchanged during v2.0 (nginx removal deferred to v2.1)
  - [ ] `ADCP_TESTING=true` gating for `/_internal/reset-db-pool` confirmed
- [ ] Pre-Wave-0 `main` branch passes `make quality` + `tox -e integration` + `tox -e bdd`
- [ ] Pre-Wave-0 `main` has `a2wsgi` Flask mount still at `src/app.py:299-304` (safety net)
- [ ] v1.99.0 git tag plan documented (last-known-good Flask-era release, tagged before Wave 3 merges)
- [ ] **Pre-Wave-0 lazy-loading audit spike completed and approved (async pivot 2026-04-11)** — enumerates every `relationship()` definition in `src/core/database/models/` and classifies every access site as safe (in-scope), fixable (eager-load), or requires-rewrite. This audit gates the Wave 4-5 async absorption scope. If the audit reveals the scope is untenable, fall back to Option C (sync def admin) and defer async to v2.1. See `async-pivot-checkpoint.md` §4 Risk #1 for the full audit procedure.
- [ ] **Pre-Wave-0 async driver compatibility spike completed (async pivot 2026-04-11)** — run the full test suite on a staging branch with `asyncpg` instead of `psycopg2-binary` to catch driver-compat surprises (JSONB codec, UUID/Interval types, LISTEN/NOTIFY API drift, COPY bulk imports). Estimated 1-2 days of debugging. See checkpoint §4 Risk #2.
- [ ] **Pre-Wave-0 Spike 4.5 — ContextManager refactor smoke test (Decision 7, 2026-04-11)** — rewrite `src/core/context_manager.py` to stateless async module functions, delete `DatabaseManager` from `database_session.py`, convert the smallest caller (`src/core/tools/creatives/_workflow.py::_create_sync_workflow_steps`) end-to-end, update `tests/harness/media_buy_update.py::EXTERNAL_PATCHES`, delete 18 lines of singleton-reset hacks in `conftest_db.py` + `integration_db.py` + `test_gam_lifecycle.py`. Pass: LOC <400 AND files <15 AND test patches <50 AND error-path composition test passes. Soft blocker (fallback: dedicated Wave 4a sub-phase). See `async-pivot-checkpoint.md` §4 Risk #20 + `CLAUDE.md` Decision 7.
- [ ] **Pre-Wave-0 Spike 5.5 — Two-engine coexistence (Decision 9, 2026-04-11)** — create MVP `src/services/background_sync_db.py` (~200 LOC separate sync psycopg2 engine) and run 4 test cases at `tests/driver_compat/test_sync_bridge_coexistence.py`: (a) lazy-init + dispose, (b) MVCC bidirectional visibility, (c) 5 concurrent async requests + 1 sync thread no deadlock, (d) post-dispose connection leaks <=1. Also validates the Wave 3 flask-caching correction (3 consumer sites at inventory.py:874, :1133, background_sync_service.py:472). Soft blocker (fallback: Option A asyncio task). See `async-pivot-checkpoint.md` §4 Risk #7.5 + `CLAUDE.md` Decision 9.
- [ ] **Agent F pre-Wave-0 hard gate items completed (non-code surface inventory, corrected 2026-04-11):**
  - [ ] **`psycopg2-binary` RETAINED** — partial reversal of Agent F F1.1.1 per Decisions 1 (Path B sync factory), 2 (pre-uvicorn health checks), 9 (sync-bridge). `asyncpg>=0.30.0,<0.32` added alongside (not replacing). `types-psycopg2` also retained. **Fallback:** `psycopg[binary,pool]>=3.2.0` if Spike 2 (driver compat) fails — see `CLAUDE.md` pre-Wave-0 spike sequence.
  - [ ] `[tool.pytest.ini_options]` added to `pyproject.toml` with `asyncio_mode = "auto"` (F1.7.1, F8.2.1)
  - [ ] `DATABASE_URL` rewriter (`sslmode` → `ssl`) landed (F1.5.1)
  - [ ] **`DatabaseConnection` KEPT** (partial reversal of F1.4.1) per Audit 06 Decision 2 OVERRULE, REFINED 2026-04-11. **Real rationale: fork safety, NOT loop collision.** `run_all_services.py` is PID 1 sync orchestrator that forks uvicorn into a child subprocess via `subprocess.Popen` at `:231`, so parent/child have independent Python interpreters. Using SQLAlchemy `get_sync_db_session()` here would duplicate pooled asyncpg/psycopg connections into the child fork → PG socket corruption (canonical SQLAlchemy fork-safety bug). Raw `psycopg2.connect()` + close-before-fork is the only safe shape.
  - [ ] **Decision 2 corrected caller list (2026-04-11):** `scripts/deploy/run_all_services.py:84,135` + `examples/upstream_quickstart.py:137`. **NOT** `init_database.py`/`init_database_ci.py` — those use SQLAlchemy `get_db_session()`, were misattributed in original Audit 06 ledger and Agent F §1.4.
  - [ ] **Delete `scripts/deploy/entrypoint_admin.sh`** in same PR — dead shell code, unreferenced by Dockerfile/compose/fly.toml, still shell-imports psycopg2 in a subshell, calls non-existent `migrate.py`, imports `src.admin.server` (scheduled for Wave 3 deletion).
  - [ ] **Migrate `examples/upstream_quickstart.py:137`** to `get_db_session()` (async-capable, standalone-safe). Leaves `DatabaseConnection` with exactly 2 callers in `run_all_services.py`.
  - [ ] **Harden `DatabaseConnection.connect()`**: add `connect_timeout=10` (env-overridable via `DATABASE_CONNECT_TIMEOUT`) and `options="-c statement_timeout=5000"` to the `psycopg2.connect(...)` call. Prevents hanging DB from bricking container startup.
  - [ ] **Structural guard #1** `tests/unit/test_architecture_no_runtime_psycopg2.py` — AST-walks every `src/**/*.py`, allowlists exactly 3 files for `import psycopg2`/`from psycopg2`: `src/core/database/db_config.py` (Decision 2 raw pre-fork path), `src/core/database/database_session.py` (Decision 1 Path B sync factory IF it explicitly imports — verify during implementation; SQLAlchemy auto-detects psycopg2 driver from URL string without an explicit import), `src/services/background_sync_db.py` (Decision 9 sync-bridge). Includes a "stale-entry" test that fails if any allowlisted file no longer imports psycopg2.
  - [ ] **Structural guard #2** `tests/unit/test_architecture_get_db_connection_callers_allowlist.py` — AST-walks every `src/**/*.py` and `scripts/**/*.py` for `Call` nodes invoking `get_db_connection`, allowlists exactly 1 file: `scripts/deploy/run_all_services.py`. Catches the failure mode where someone adds `DatabaseConnection` inside the runtime process (fork-unsafe AND pool-uncoordinated). Excludes `db_config.py` (definition file) and `examples/`/`tests/` by directory scope.
  - [ ] **Risk #34 (NEW, HIGH)**: `run_all_services.py:175` imports `src.core.database.database.init_db` which under async pivot opens the SQLAlchemy async engine in the parent process. Then `:231` `Popen`s uvicorn — duplicate pooled connection FDs leak into the child. Either (a) `init_db()` calls `await reset_engine()` in `finally`, OR (b) `run_all_services.py` runs init via `subprocess.run([sys.executable, "-m", "scripts.setup.init_database"])` like migrations already do at `:207`. **Strongly prefer (b)** — matches the existing migration pattern, no in-process state leak risk. Add to async-pivot-checkpoint.md §4 risk register.
  - [ ] **Spike 5.5 additional check**: verify `run_all_services.py`'s init flow does NOT eagerly hold any PG sockets in the parent process after `init_database()` returns and before `threading.Thread(target=run_mcp_server).start()`. Either grep `/proc/<pid>/fd/` for PG sockets (Linux) or run `pg_stat_activity` query and confirm zero connections from PID 1 outside of the transient `DatabaseConnection` window.
  - [ ] ~~Alembic `env.py` async rewrite validated via Spike 6~~ **ELIMINATED per DB-4 (database deep-audit 2026-04-11): keep `env.py` sync with psycopg2.** Alembic gains nothing from running async — migrations are serial, single-connection operations. All 161 existing migrations use sync patterns that work under the greenlet bridge. Spike 6 scope reduced to: `render_item` hook for JSONType + advisory lock for multi-container safety (~0.5 day, not full async rewrite).
  - [ ] CI Postgres version aligned to 17 across all workflows (F2.4.1)
  - [ ] Dead `test-migrations` pre-commit hook removed (F2.3.1)
  - [ ] 3 new structural guards added (F6.2.1, F6.2.5, F6.2.6)
  - [ ] New docs `async-debugging.md` + `async-cookbook.md` drafted (F5.3.1, F5.3.2)
  - [ ] Full `asyncpg` wheel availability verified for glibc + macOS (F1.1.3)
  - [ ] Duplication baseline snapshotted at Wave 4 start (F7.4.1)

### 1.2 Architectural decisions recorded in the migration plan

- [ ] **Admin handlers `async def` end-to-end with full async SQLAlchemy** — pivoted 2026-04-11 from Option C (sync def) to Option A (full async absorbed into v2.0 Waves 4-5) — per deep audit blocker #4 (rewritten); documented in `flask-to-fastapi-migration.md` §2.8, `async-pivot-checkpoint.md`, and full new scope in §18 of the migration doc
- [ ] **Middleware order: Approximated BEFORE CSRF** (corrected) — per deep audit blocker #5; documented in `flask-to-fastapi-migration.md` §2.8 and §10.2
- [ ] **Redirect status code: 307** (not 302) — preserves POST body per RFC 7231
- [ ] **`FLASK_SECRET_KEY` transition: dual-read during v2.0, hard-remove in v2.1** (supersedes original user directive #5) — documented in `flask-to-fastapi-deep-audit.md` §3.4
- [ ] **Error-shape split decided:** Category 1 native `{"detail": ...}`, Category 2 legacy `{"success": false, "error": ...}` via scoped handler — documented in `flask-to-fastapi-migration.md` §2 directive #8
- [ ] **Decision 1 (adapter Path B, 2026-04-11):** adapter methods stay sync `def`; 18 call sites in `src/core/tools/*.py` + 1 in `src/admin/blueprints/operations.py:252` wrap in `await run_in_threadpool(...)`. `src/core/database/database_session.py` exports `get_sync_db_session()` alongside async `get_db_session()` (dual session factory). `AuditLogger.log_operation` splits into `_log_operation_sync` (internal) + async public wrapper. `anyio.to_thread.current_default_thread_limiter().total_tokens = 80` at lifespan startup. Structural guard `test_architecture_adapter_calls_wrapped_in_threadpool.py`. Full implementation reference: `flask-to-fastapi-foundation-modules.md` §11.14. Full target state: `async-pivot-checkpoint.md` §3 "Adapters (Decision 1 Path B)".
- [ ] **Decision 7 (ContextManager refactor, 2026-04-11):** delete `ContextManager` class + `DatabaseManager` entirely. 12 public methods become stateless `async def` module functions taking `session: AsyncSession` as first parameter. 7 production callers migrate (incl. dead `main.py:166` + module-load side effect in `mcp_context_wrapper.py:345` + `mock_ad_server.py threading.Thread → asyncio.create_task`). ~50 test patches, 20 collapsible via `tests/harness/media_buy_update.py::EXTERNAL_PATCHES` update. Validated by Spike 4.5. Structural guard `test_architecture_no_singleton_session.py`. Error-path composition gotcha: use SEPARATE `async with session_scope()` for error-logging writes (outer scope rolls back on raise). Full target state: `async-pivot-checkpoint.md` §3 "ContextManager refactor".
- [ ] **Decision 9 (background_sync sync-bridge, 2026-04-11):** new `src/services/background_sync_db.py` module with separate sync psycopg2 engine (pool 2+3, statement_timeout=600s, `application_name='adcp-salesagent-sync-bridge'`). Background threads stay sync. `psycopg2-binary` + `libpq5` + `libpq-dev` all retained in `pyproject.toml` + `Dockerfile` (partial reversal of Agent F F1.1.1/F1.2.1). Wave 3 flask-caching correction bundled: 3 consumer sites (inventory.py:874, :1133, background_sync_service.py:472), SimpleAppCache replacement required before deletion, closes `from flask import current_app` ImportError at line 472. Validated by Spike 5.5. Structural guard `test_architecture_sync_bridge_scope.py` with ratcheting allowlist. Sunset v2.1+. Full target state: `async-pivot-checkpoint.md` §3 "Background sync sync-bridge".
- [ ] **Decision 3 (factory-boy async shim, refined 2026-04-11):** custom `AsyncSQLAlchemyModelFactory` overrides `_save` (not `_create`), `sqlalchemy_session_persistence = None`, `session.add(instance)` directly (no `sync_session.add`), NO `flush()` call. 3 bugs fixed from Audit 06 recipe. Wave 4b-4c hard cliff: all 166 integration tests must flip async BEFORE factory base classes flip. New Spike 4.25 (0.5 day, soft blocker). 3 structural guards: `test_architecture_factory_inherits_async_base.py`, `test_architecture_factory_no_post_generation.py`, `test_architecture_factory_in_all_factories.py`. Full recipe: `foundation-modules.md` §11.13.1 (D).
- [ ] **Decision 4 (queries.py convert-and-prune, refined 2026-04-11):** 6 functions (not 7), zero production callers, 3 dead functions → delete + allowlist cleanup. 3 live functions → async conversion. Test file `test_creative_review_model.py` converts to async. Net: ~−100 LOC. Move to `CreativeRepository` deferred to v2.1 (Option 4B).
- [ ] **Decision 5 (database_schema.py + product_pricing.py DELETE, refined 2026-04-11):** `database_schema.py` confirmed orphan → delete Wave 5. `product_pricing.py` has 1 caller already eager-loading, inspect-guard defeated by unconditional log at line 43 → DELETE entirely in Wave 4, inline conversion at single caller as `AdminPricingOptionView` Pydantic DTO. Supersedes Audit 06 SUBSTITUTE (RuntimeError prescription was technically ineffective).
- [ ] **Decision 6 (flask-caching → SimpleAppCache, refined 2026-04-11):** ~90 LOC module with `cachetools.TTLCache(maxsize=1024, ttl=300)` + `threading.RLock` + `_NullAppCache` fallback + `CacheBackend` Protocol. Both inventory sites rewritten to cache dicts not Flask Response objects. `cache_key`+`cache_time_key` folded into single 2-tuple entry. 12-step strict migration order in Wave 3 PR. 2 structural guards. Full recipe: `foundation-modules.md` §11.15.
- [ ] **Decision 8 (SSE DELETE, 2026-04-11):** `/tenant/{id}/events` SSE route is orphan code — template says "use polling", zero EventSource consumers. DELETE route + generator + rate-limit state + HEAD probe in Wave 4. Fix `api_mode=False → True` on surviving `/activity` JSON poll route. −170 LOC, −1 pip dep (`sse_starlette`). Structural guard `test_architecture_no_sse_handlers.py`.
- [ ] **Admin router OpenAPI: `include_in_schema=False`** — documented in `flask-to-fastapi-adcp-safety.md` §3
- [ ] **`gam_reporting_api.py` reclassified Category 2 → Category 1** (session-cookie authed = admin-UI-only) — documented
- [ ] **`tenant_management_api.py` route count fixed 19 → 6** in plan docs
- [ ] **Session cookie name: `session` → `adcp_session`** — one forced re-login at cutover is acceptable (user decision #7)
- [ ] **Scheduler stays single-worker in v2.0** — documented as a hard constraint; multi-worker deferred to v2.2 (requires scheduler lease design)

---

## Section 2 — Six deep-audit blockers (must all be fixed in Wave 0 or Wave 1)

Full detail in `flask-to-fastapi-deep-audit.md` §1.

- [ ] **Blocker 1: `script_root` / `script_name` template breakage — GREENFIELD: full `url_for` adoption**
  - [ ] `src/admin/templating.py::render()` wrapper has NO `admin_prefix`/`static_prefix`/`script_root`/`script_name` in its context dict
  - [ ] `src/admin/templating.py` pre-registers `_url_for` safe-lookup override on `templates.env.globals` BEFORE any `TemplateResponse` call (catches `NoMatchFound`, logs template filename + route name + params, re-raises)
  - [ ] `app.mount("/static", StaticFiles(directory="src/admin/static"), name="static")` on the outer FastAPI app — `name="static"` is load-bearing for `url_for('static', path=...)` resolution via `Mount.url_path_for` at `starlette/routing.py:434-459`
  - [ ] Every admin route has `name="admin_<blueprint>_<endpoint>"` on its decorator (e.g., `@router.get("/tenant/{tenant_id}/accounts", name="admin_accounts_list_accounts")`)
  - [ ] `scripts/codemod_templates_greenfield.py` exists and implements a two-pass regex rewrite:
    - [ ] Pass 1a: `{{ script_name }}/static/foo.css` → `{{ url_for('static', path='/foo.css') }}`
    - [ ] Pass 1b: `{{ script_name }}/tenant/{{ tenant_id }}/settings` → `{{ url_for('admin_tenants_settings', tenant_id=tenant_id) }}` via `HARDCODED_PATH_TO_ROUTE` map
    - [ ] Pass 2: `{{ url_for('bp.endpoint', ...) }}` Flask-dotted → `{{ url_for('admin_bp_endpoint', ...) }}` via `FLASK_TO_FASTAPI_NAME` map
  - [ ] `scripts/generate_route_name_map.py` exists and produces `FLASK_TO_FASTAPI_NAME` and `HARDCODED_PATH_TO_ROUTE` from `src/admin/app.py::create_app().url_map.iter_rules()` introspection
  - [ ] Codemod runs successfully against all 72 templates; stdout reports `"N templates processed, M rewrites applied"`
  - [ ] Codemod is idempotent — re-running on post-codemod templates yields zero diff (`tests/unit/admin/test_codemod_idempotent.py` green)
  - [ ] Manual audit of `add_product_gam.html` for JS-literal edge cases (15 `url_for` calls in JS template literals) — verify the `JS_TEMPLATE_LITERAL_RE` pre-pass flags them for manual review
  - [ ] Manual audit of `base.html` (7 `{{ script_name }}` references — highest-fanout template)
  - [ ] Manual audit of `tenant_dashboard.html` (21 `script_name` references — highest-complexity template)
  - [ ] `tests/unit/admin/test_templates_no_hardcoded_admin_paths.py` green — asserts zero matches for `script_name|script_root|admin_prefix|static_prefix` AND zero bare `"/admin/"` / `"/static/"` string literals
  - [ ] `tests/unit/admin/test_templates_url_for_resolves.py` green — AST-extracts every `url_for('name', ...)` and asserts `name` is in `{r.name for r in app.routes}` (catches `NoMatchFound` footgun at CI time)
  - [ ] `tests/unit/admin/test_architecture_admin_routes_named.py` green — AST-scans `src/admin/routers/*.py` and asserts every `@router.<method>(...)` has `name=` kwarg
  - [ ] For JS URL construction with runtime path params: handlers pre-resolve base URLs via `js_*_base` context vars (e.g., `js_workflows_base=str(request.url_for("admin_workflows_list_workflows", tenant_id=tenant_id))`); templates use `const base = "{{ js_workflows_base }}";`
- [ ] **Blocker 2: Trailing-slash 404 divergence (111 `url_for` calls at risk)**
  - [ ] Every admin router constructed with `APIRouter(redirect_slashes=True, include_in_schema=False)`
  - [ ] OR: the aggregated admin router in `build_admin_router()` sets `redirect_slashes=True` and nested sub-routers inherit cleanly (verified)
  - [ ] `tests/admin/test_trailing_slash_tolerance.py` exists and is green — iterates every registered admin route, hits both `path` and `path + "/"`, asserts neither returns 404
- [ ] **Blocker 3: `AdCPError` JSON-to-HTML browser regression**
  - [ ] `src/app.py::adcp_error_handler` is Accept-aware — if `request.url.path.startswith("/admin")` AND `"text/html" in accept`, render `error.html` via `src/admin/templating.templates`
  - [ ] `templates/error.html` (or `src/admin/templates/error.html` after Wave 3 move) exists, extends `base.html`, renders error message + back link
  - [ ] `tests/integration/test_admin_error_page.py` exists — forces `AdCPValidationError` from inside an admin route, asserts HTML response (not JSON), asserts body contains the error message
- [ ] **Blocker 4: ~~Async event-loop session interleaving~~ DEFERRED TO v2.1 (async pivot reversed 2026-04-12). v2.0 uses sync `def` handlers — scoped_session thread-local identity works correctly in FastAPI's threadpool. The entire Blocker 4 checklist below is v2.1 scope.**
  - [ ] Pre-Wave-0 lazy-loading audit spike completed and approved (Risk #1 in `async-pivot-checkpoint.md` §4) — enumerates every `relationship()` access site and classifies as safe / eager-loadable / requires-rewrite
  - [ ] `src/core/database/database_session.py` converted: `create_engine` → `create_async_engine`, `scoped_session(sessionmaker(...))` → `async_sessionmaker(_engine, class_=AsyncSession, expire_on_commit=False)`
  - [ ] `get_db_session()` is an `@asynccontextmanager` yielding `AsyncSession`
  - [ ] Driver addition: `asyncpg>=0.30.0,<0.32` added alongside (NOT replacing) `psycopg2-binary` + `types-psycopg2` in `pyproject.toml` — psycopg2 RETAINED per Decisions 1 (Path B sync adapter factory), 2 (pre-fork orchestrator health check), and 9 (sync-bridge for background sync). Removal deferred to v2.1+.
  - [ ] ~~`alembic/env.py` uses async adapter~~ **ELIMINATED per DB-4: `env.py` stays sync with psycopg2** — see Section 1.1 Spike 6 correction above. `postgresql+asyncpg://` URL rewriting is applied ONLY at async engine construction in `database_session.py`, NOT in Alembic.
  - [ ] All repository classes use `async def` methods with `(await session.execute(select(...))).scalars().first()` pattern
  - [ ] All UoW classes implement `async def __aenter__` / `async def __aexit__` — OR deleted entirely under the Agent E idiom upgrade (FastAPI DI request-scoped session IS the unit of work; see `async-pivot-checkpoint.md` §3)
  - [ ] All admin router handlers are `async def` with `async with get_db_session()` / `await` DB calls (or, preferred, `session: SessionDep` via `Depends(get_session)`)
  - [ ] All `src/core/tools/*.py` `_impl` functions are `async def` (some already are)
  - [ ] `tests/harness/_base.py::IntegrationEnv` uses `async def __aenter__` / `async def __aexit__`
  - [ ] `factory_boy` adapter — one of the three options in `async-pivot-checkpoint.md` §3 chosen and implemented
  - [ ] All integration tests converted to `async def` + `@pytest.mark.asyncio` (or anyio equivalent)
  - [ ] `run_in_threadpool` used ONLY for file I/O, CPU-bound work, and sync third-party libraries — never for DB access
  - [ ] `tests/unit/test_architecture_admin_routes_async.py` exists and is green — AST-scans `src/admin/routers/*.py` and asserts every `@router.<method>(...)` handler is `async def`
  - [ ] `tests/unit/test_architecture_admin_async_db_access.py` exists and is green — AST-scans admin routers and asserts DB call-sites use `async with get_db_session()` + `await session.execute(...)` rather than sync `with` or `run_in_threadpool(_sync_fetch)`
  - [ ] The stale `tests/unit/test_architecture_admin_sync_db_no_async.py` is NOT created (wrong direction under the pivot)
  - [ ] Foundation module examples in `flask-to-fastapi-foundation-modules.md` updated to `async def` + async DB patterns
  - [ ] Worked examples in `flask-to-fastapi-worked-examples.md` updated to `async def` + async DB patterns (OAuth / favicon upload examples preserve their async outer signatures but drop `run_in_threadpool` wrappers around DB helper calls; ~~SSE example~~ **STALE — D8 DELETE: SSE worked example is moot, replace with JSON poll `/activity` example**)
  - [ ] Main overview §13 `accounts.py` examples updated to `async def`
  - [ ] Connection pool `pool_size` bumped to match or exceed pre-migration sync threadpool capacity (Risk #6)
  - [ ] `created_at` / `updated_at` post-commit access audited (Risk #5 — `expire_on_commit=False` consequence)
  - [ ] Async vs pre-migration sync benchmark run on representative admin routes; latency profile net-neutral to ~5% improvement
- [ ] **Blocker 5: Middleware ordering — Approximated must run BEFORE CSRF**
  - [ ] `src/app.py` middleware stack registered in this order (outermost → innermost):
    1. `CORSMiddleware`
    2. `SessionMiddleware`
    3. `ApproximatedExternalDomainMiddleware`  ← MOVED UP from below CSRF
    4. `CSRFMiddleware`
    5. `RestCompatMiddleware`
    6. `UnifiedAuthMiddleware`
  - [ ] `ApproximatedExternalDomainMiddleware` redirect status is **307** (not 302) to preserve POST body per RFC 7231 §6.4.7
  - [ ] `tests/integration/test_external_domain_post_redirects_before_csrf.py` exists and is green — POSTs to `/admin/tenant/t1/accounts/create` with `Apx-Incoming-Host: ads.example.com`, no CSRF token, no session; asserts response is 307 (not 403)
- [ ] **Blocker 6: OAuth redirect URIs byte-identical**
  - [ ] `tests/unit/test_oauth_redirect_uris_immutable.py` exists and pins the EXACT set:
    - `/admin/auth/google/callback`
    - `/admin/auth/oidc/callback` (NO `{tenant_id}` — tenant context is in the session; corrected per FE-3 audit 2026-04-11, verified at `src/admin/blueprints/oidc.py:209`)
    - `/admin/auth/gam/callback` (WITH `/admin` prefix — corrected per FE-3 audit 2026-04-11, verified at `src/admin/blueprints/auth.py:931,959`)
  - [ ] Guard test asserts each expected route is in `{r.path for r in app.routes if hasattr(r, "path")}`
  - [ ] `src/admin/oauth.py` carries a comment referencing the byte-identity requirement
  - [ ] Wave 1 staging smoke test walks the REAL Google OAuth flow end-to-end (documented and executed before Wave 2 begins)

## Section 3 — First-order audit action items (from adcp-safety.md §7)

Full detail in `flask-to-fastapi-adcp-safety.md` §7.

- [ ] **Near-blocker:** `ApproximatedExternalDomainMiddleware` preserves the `is_admin_request` path gate from `src/admin/app.py:226-230` — ASGI port short-circuits on any path not starting with `/admin` (distinct test from Blocker 5 — this one guards the gate itself, not the ordering)
- [ ] Fix stale `tenant_management_api.py` route count **19 → 6** in `flask-to-fastapi-migration.md` §3.2
- [ ] `gam_reporting_api.py` reclassified **Category 2 → Category 1** (session-cookie authed); removed from `_LEGACY_PATH_PREFIXES` tuple; documented in main overview §2.8
- [ ] `/schemas/adcp/v2.4/*` external contract preserved — contract test `tests/integration/test_schemas_discovery_external_contract.py` exists and is green, pinning JSON shape and 404/500 body shape byte-for-byte
- [ ] Webhook payload preservation manual Wave 2 code review for:
  - [ ] `src/admin/blueprints/creatives.py` — `create_a2a_webhook_payload`, `create_mcp_webhook_payload`, `adcp.types.*` scoped to outbound webhook construction only
  - [ ] `src/admin/blueprints/operations.py` — same
  - [ ] **No `adcp.types.*` used as `response_model=`** on admin FastAPI routes
- [ ] `include_in_schema=False` on `build_admin_router()` — one-line applied
- [ ] `/_internal/` added to `CSRFMiddleware._EXEMPT_PATH_PREFIXES` in `src/admin/csrf.py`
- [ ] Three new structural guards exist and are green (from first-order audit):
  - [ ] `tests/unit/test_architecture_csrf_exempt_covers_adcp.py` — every non-GET route matching `/mcp`, `/a2a`, `/api/v1/`, `/a2a/` is covered by `_EXEMPT_PATH_PREFIXES`
  - [ ] `tests/unit/test_architecture_approximated_middleware_path_gated.py` — middleware short-circuits on any path not starting with `/admin`
  - [ ] `tests/unit/test_architecture_admin_routes_excluded_from_openapi.py` — `not any(p.startswith("/admin") for p in app.openapi()["paths"])`

## Section 3.5 — Verification audit findings (3-round Opus audit, 2026-04-12)

Three rounds of parallel Opus subagent verification (14 agents total) audited the plan against actual source code, derivative consequences, silent breaking bugs, code pattern consistency, CLAUDE.md compliance, and senior engineering practices. All findings below are scoped into specific waves.

### 3.5.1 Silent breaking bugs (pass all tests, break production)

- [ ] **[DEFERRED v2.1]** **SB-1 [CRITICAL, Wave 4b]: Product `@property` methods trigger lazy loads on 3 relationships.** `src/core/database/models.py:341-489` — five `@property` methods (`effective_format_ids`, `effective_properties`, `effective_property_tags`, `effective_implementation_config`, `is_gam_tenant`) access `self.inventory_profile`, `self.tenant`, `self.adapter_config`. `ProductRepository.list_all()` eagerly loads `tenant` and `pricing_options` but NOT `inventory_profile`. Production paths raise `MissingGreenlet`. **Fix:** Add `selectinload(Product.inventory_profile)` to all Product repository methods whose callers access these properties. Add to Spike 1 acceptance criteria: every Product `@property` must be exercised against every repo method.
- [ ] **SB-2 [CRITICAL, Wave 2]: `request.form.getlist()` — 20+ call sites silently lose multi-value form data.** `src/admin/blueprints/products.py` has 12+ calls for `<select multiple>` fields (countries, channels, formats, principals, property_tags). FastAPI `Form()` returns only the LAST value, not a list. **Fix:** Use `List[str] = Form()` for multi-value fields. Add foundation-module pattern doc and structural guard `test_architecture_form_getlist_parity.py` in Wave 0.
- [ ] **SB-3 [HIGH, Wave 0]: `session.*` and `g.*` template variables silently render as empty.** `templates/base.html:145` uses `{% if g.test_mode %}` (test mode banner); lines 155-183 read `session.role`, `session.authenticated`, `session.email`. Starlette does NOT auto-inject `g` or `session` into Jinja context. **Fix:** `render()` wrapper must pass `test_mode`, `user_role`, `user_email`, `user_authenticated`, `username` as explicit context variables. Add `test_template_context_completeness.py` guard asserting every variable used in `base.html` is present in `render()` context dict.
- [ ] **[v2.0: document risk only. v2.1: mandatory fix.]** **SB-4 [HIGH, Wave 4a]: `onupdate=func.now()` columns permanently stale after UPDATE+commit.** Unlike `server_default` (INSERT-time, covered by Risk #5), `onupdate=func.now()` fires on UPDATE. With `expire_on_commit=False`, response returns OLD `updated_at`. Cannot be fixed with ORM-side `default=`. **Fix:** Set `obj.updated_at = func.now()` application-side before commit, or `await session.refresh(obj, ['updated_at'])` after commit. Add `test_onupdate_columns_refreshed.py` in Wave 4.
- [ ] **[DEFERRED v2.1]** **SB-5 [HIGH, Wave 4b]: N+1 lazy load in `get_object_lifecycle` (`context_manager.py:430`).** Inside a loop, `mapping.workflow_step` triggers per-row lazy load → `MissingGreenlet` under async. **Fix:** Add `joinedload(ObjectWorkflowMapping.workflow_step)` to the query at line 414.

### 3.5.2 Loud but scoped breaks (caught by tests)

- [ ] **[DEFERRED v2.1]** **LB-1 [HIGH, Spike 2 + Wave 4a]: `asyncpg` bypasses `json_serializer` parameter.** `database_session.py:114,130` passes `json_serializer=_pydantic_json_serializer` to `create_engine`. asyncpg uses its own native JSONB codec that ignores this. Pydantic types fail with `TypeError` on JSONB write. **Fix:** Register custom asyncpg JSONB codec via `asyncpg.Connection.set_type_codec()` at engine-level `connect` event. Add `test_jsonb_roundtrip_asyncpg.py` to Spike 2 criteria.
- [ ] **[DEFERRED v2.1]** **LB-2 [HIGH, Wave 4a]: `statement_timeout` event listener crashes under asyncpg.** `database_session.py:139-144` uses `dbapi_conn.cursor()` which doesn't exist on asyncpg connections. **Fix:** Replace with `connect_args={"server_settings": {"statement_timeout": "30000"}}` on async engine. Already corrected in `async-pivot-checkpoint.md` code block (2026-04-12).
- [ ] **[DEFERRED v2.1]** **LB-3 [MEDIUM, Wave 4b]: `bulk_insert_mappings` / `bulk_update_mappings` removed in `AsyncSession`.** `gam_inventory_service.py:98,104,734,739`. **Fix:** Rewrite to Core `insert().values()` pattern. These are inside the sync-bridge scope (Decision 9), so they stay sync but must use `get_sync_db_session()`, not the async session.

### 3.5.3 Scope gaps (not previously in any wave — now added)

- [ ] **SG-1 [CRITICAL, Wave 2c + Wave 3]: `gam_inventory_service.py` has 8 Flask routes NOT in any wave scope.** `src/services/gam_inventory_service.py:1484-1680` — `create_inventory_endpoints(app)` registers 8 `@app.route()` decorators directly on the Flask app (called from `src/admin/app.py:391`). These live in `src/services/`, not `src/admin/blueprints/`, so they are missed by the Wave 2 "22 blueprints" scope. **Fix:** Port to `src/admin/routers/inventory_api.py` in Wave 2c. Delete `create_inventory_endpoints()` in Wave 3.
- [ ] **SG-2 [CRITICAL, Wave 3]: `atexit` handlers incompatible with async shutdown.** `src/services/webhook_delivery_service.py:185` and `src/services/delivery_simulator.py:45` register `atexit.register(self._shutdown)`. Under uvicorn, `atexit` fires AFTER the event loop is closed. **Fix:** Move to FastAPI lifespan post-yield block in Wave 3.
- [ ] **SG-3 [HIGH, Wave 2c]: `register_ui_routes(app: Flask)` adapter interface not addressed.** `src/adapters/base.py:481`, `google_ad_manager.py:1694`, `mock_ad_server.py:1346` take a Flask `app` object. **Fix:** Change interface to accept `APIRouter` in Wave 2c; re-home content into `src/admin/routers/adapters.py`.
- [ ] **[v2.0: document risk only. v2.1: mandatory fix.]** **SG-4 [HIGH, Wave 4]: GAM services have private `scoped_session` instances.** `gam_inventory_service.py` and `gam_orders_service.py` create their own module-level `scoped_session` bypassing `database_session.py`. **Fix:** Migrate to centralized `get_sync_db_session()` (Decision 9 sync-bridge) in Wave 4. Add structural guard `test_architecture_no_private_scoped_session.py`.
- [ ] **SG-5 [HIGH, Wave 1b]: `SameSite=None` → `Lax` may break OIDC `form_post` callbacks.** `src/admin/app.py:117` currently sets `SESSION_COOKIE_SAMESITE = "None"`. OIDC providers using `response_mode=form_post` send cross-origin POSTs — `SameSite=Lax` blocks the cookie. **Fix:** Investigate which OIDC providers use `form_post` vs `query`. If any use `form_post`, the CSRF strategy needs adjustment. Add `test_oidc_form_post_samesite.py` in Wave 1b.
- [ ] **SG-6 [MEDIUM, Wave 2+3]: 7 files outside `src/admin/` import Flask.** `background_sync_service.py:472`, `gam_inventory_service.py` (8 sites), `gam_inventory_discovery.py:1074`, `gam_reporting_api.py:16,68`, `mock_ad_server.py:1349`, `google_ad_manager.py:25,1696`. **Fix:** Each must be migrated or removed per-wave. Track in `test_architecture_no_flask_imports.py` allowlist.

### 3.5.4 Async edge cases (from SQLAlchemy async specialist audit)

- [ ] **[DEFERRED v2.1]** **AE-1 [CRITICAL, Spike 1]: Product `@property` lazy-load audit.** 5 properties across 3 relationships — see SB-1. Spike 1's `lazy="raise"` blanket must exercise these properties explicitly, not just run integration tests that happen to use eager-loading code paths.
- [ ] **[DEFERRED v2.1]** **AE-2 [HIGH, Spike 2]: asyncpg JSONB codec incompatibility.** See LB-1. Add to Spike 2 pass criteria: Pydantic-typed JSONB roundtrip test.
- [ ] **[DEFERRED v2.1]** **AE-3 [HIGH, Wave 4b]: `session.merge()` in `delivery.py:274` needs `await`.** Missing `await` returns a coroutine object, not the merged instance.
- [ ] **[DEFERRED v2.1]** **AE-4 [MEDIUM, Wave 4b]: `inspect(product)` + lazy load in `product_pricing.py:38-43`.** Line 43 unconditionally accesses `product.pricing_options`. Under async → `MissingGreenlet`. File is deleted per Decision 5, so this is self-resolving.

### 3.5.5 Testing infrastructure additions (6 components, ~2,125 LOC)

- [ ] **TI-1 [Phase -1]: Response fingerprint system (~430 LOC).** Capture Flask response shapes as committed JSON fixtures before Wave 1; compare against FastAPI per-wave. Files: `tests/migration/fingerprint.py`, `tests/migration/conftest_fingerprint.py`, `tests/migration/test_response_fingerprints.py`, `tests/migration/fixtures/fingerprints/*.json`.
- [ ] **TI-2 [Phase 1a-2c]: Dual-stack shadow test mode (~255 LOC).** During Waves 1-2 (both stacks coexist), shadow-test safe requests against both Flask and FastAPI, compare responses. Files: `tests/migration/dual_stack_client.py`, `tests/migration/conftest_dual_stack.py`.
- [ ] **[DEFERRED v2.1]** **TI-3 [Phase 4a]: Async correctness test harness (~410 LOC).** Concurrent session isolation, MissingGreenlet provocation, event loop blocking detection, connection pool stress. Files: `tests/migration/test_async_correctness.py`, `tests/migration/blocking_detector.py`.
- [ ] **TI-4 [Phase -1]: Structural guard meta-tests (~400 LOC).** Each new guard gets a "known violation" fixture proving it catches errors. Companion coverage test prevents guard rot. File: `tests/unit/test_architecture_guard_meta.py`.
- [ ] **TI-5 [Phase -1 through Phase 5]: Wave checkpoint tests (~300 LOC).** Per-wave invariant gates (route parity, import counts, schema match). File: `tests/migration/test_wave_checkpoints.py`.
- [ ] **TI-6 [Phase 3+]: Production canary system (~330 LOC).** Post-deploy synthetic transactions, health check expansion (`/health/deep`), metric comparison, auto-rollback triggers. Files: `scripts/canary/production_canary.py`, `src/routes/health_deep.py`.

### 3.5.6 Engineering practice additions (from senior eng audit)

- [ ] **EP-1 [Phase 0]: Feature flag for Flask/FastAPI routing toggle (~50 LOC).** `ADCP_USE_FASTAPI_ADMIN=true/false` routes `/admin/*` traffic between stacks. Enables instant rollback without container swaps. Eliminates Wave 2 code freeze. Removed in Wave 3.
- [ ] **EP-2 [Phase 0]: `X-Served-By` response header (~20 LOC).** Middleware adds `X-Served-By: flask` or `X-Served-By: fastapi` during dual-mount phase. Makes "zero Flask traffic" assertion verifiable.
- [ ] **EP-3 [Phase 0]: Shared `form_error_response()` helper.** DRY pattern for form-validation-error re-rendering across 25 router files. Prevents duplication caught by `check_code_duplication.py`.
- [ ] **EP-4 [All waves]: Golden-fixture characterization tests.** Before each router port, capture Flask response shapes as golden fixtures. After port, assert FastAPI matches. TDD adaptation for ports.
- [ ] **EP-5 [All waves]: FIXME comments at source for all new allowlist entries.** Per CLAUDE.md structural guard rules: "Every allowlisted violation has a `FIXME(salesagent-xxxx)` comment at the source location."
- [ ] **EP-6 [Wave 0]: Relationship count corrected to 68.** All doc references to "58 relationships" updated to 68 (verified by grep of `src/core/database/models.py`).
- [ ] **EP-7 [Wave 1b]: Customer communication plan for forced re-login.** Fortune 500 clients need 48-hour advance notice, not just a team announcement.

### 3.5.7 Code pattern corrections (from consistency audit)

- [ ] **CP-1 [Wave 0 design]: Repositories return ORM objects, NOT DTOs.** `list_dtos()` method removed from repository examples. DTO conversion happens in handler layer: `dtos = [AccountDTO.from_orm(a) for a in repo.list_all(...)]`. Corrected in `async-pivot-checkpoint.md` (2026-04-12).
- [ ] **CP-2 [Wave 2]: `request.form.getlist()` → `List[str] = Form()` migration pattern.** Document the FastAPI equivalent for multi-value form fields in foundation-modules worked examples.

**Files created — all 11 foundation modules plus supporting infra:**

- [ ] `src/admin/templating.py` (~150 LOC) — `Jinja2Templates` singleton, `_url_for` safe-lookup override pre-registered on `templates.env.globals`, `render()` wrapper with greenfield context (NO `admin_prefix`/`static_prefix`/`script_root`; only `request`, `support_email`, `sales_agent_domain`, `csrf_token`, plus handler-provided context keys)
- [ ] `src/admin/flash.py` (~70 LOC) — `flash(request, msg)` / `get_flashed_messages(request, with_categories=False)`
- [ ] `src/admin/sessions.py` (~40 LOC) — `build_session_middleware_kwargs()` returning `secret_key` from `SESSION_SECRET` (with dual-read of `FLASK_SECRET_KEY` for v2.0), `session_cookie='adcp_session'`, `same_site='lax'`, `https_only=True` in production
- [ ] `src/admin/oauth.py` (~60 LOC) — Authlib `starlette_client.OAuth` instance, Google client registered, `GOOGLE_CLIENT_NAME = "google"` constant, comment referencing OAuth URI immutability
- [ ] `src/admin/csrf.py` (~100 LOC) — pure-ASGI `CSRFMiddleware`, header-only read (never `await receive()`), `_EXEMPT_PATH_PREFIXES` includes `/mcp`, `/a2a`, `/api/v1/`, `/_internal/`, `/admin/auth/callback`, `/admin/auth/oidc/`, plus `csrf_token(request)` Jinja helper
- [ ] `src/admin/app_factory.py` (~80 LOC) — `build_admin_router()` returns `APIRouter(prefix="/admin", tags=["admin"], include_in_schema=False, redirect_slashes=True)`, empty in Wave 0
- [ ] `src/admin/deps/__init__.py` (2 LOC)
- [ ] `src/admin/deps/auth.py` (~260 LOC) — `CurrentUserDep`, `RequireAdminDep`, `RequireSuperAdminDep` as `Annotated[...]` aliases; dep functions are `async def` with `async with get_db_session()` / `await db.execute(...)` per the full-async pivot (2026-04-11)
- [ ] `src/admin/deps/tenant.py` (~90 LOC) — `CurrentTenantDep` filters `tenant.is_active=True` (fixes pre-existing latent bug)
- [ ] `src/admin/deps/audit.py` (~110 LOC) — FastAPI `Depends()`-based audit port (rewritten, not ported one-for-one); cached `AuditLogger` via `request.state`, not `flask.g`
- [ ] `src/admin/middleware/__init__.py` (2 LOC)
- [ ] `src/admin/middleware/external_domain.py` (~90 LOC) — pure-ASGI `ApproximatedExternalDomainMiddleware`, hard-gated on `/admin` path prefix, uses status 307 for redirects
- [ ] `src/admin/middleware/fly_headers.py` (~40 LOC) — pure-ASGI, may become unneeded if uvicorn `--proxy-headers` covers Fly.io (assumption #21)
- [ ] `src/admin/routers/__init__.py` (2 LOC)

**Template codemod:**

- [ ] `scripts/codemod_templates_greenfield.py` (~200 LOC) exists — two-pass regex rewrite
- [ ] `scripts/generate_route_name_map.py` (~50 LOC) exists — imports `src.admin.app.create_app()` and produces `FLASK_TO_FASTAPI_NAME` + `HARDCODED_PATH_TO_ROUTE` maps from `url_map.iter_rules()` introspection
- [ ] Codemod handles all greenfield transformations:
  - [ ] `{{ url_for('bp.endpoint', **kw) }}` → `{{ url_for('admin_bp_endpoint', **kw) }}` (Flask-dotted → flat admin-prefixed) — Pass 2
  - [ ] `{{ script_name }}/static/foo.css` → `{{ url_for('static', path='/foo.css') }}` — Pass 1a
  - [ ] `{{ script_name }}/tenant/{{ tenant_id }}/settings` → `{{ url_for('admin_tenants_settings', tenant_id=tenant_id) }}` via `HARDCODED_PATH_TO_ROUTE` — Pass 1b
  - [ ] `{{ script_name }}/logout` → `{{ url_for('admin_auth_logout') }}` — Pass 1b
  - [ ] `request.script_root` / `request.script_name` / `script_root` / `script_name` → **DELETED** (never appears in greenfield templates)
  - [ ] `csrf_token()` → `csrf_token` (Jinja variable, codemod Pass 0)
  - [ ] `get_flashed_messages(...)` → `get_flashed_messages(request, ...)` (add `request` first arg, codemod Pass 0)
  - [ ] `g.test_mode` → `test_mode` (drop `g.` prefix, codemod Pass 0)
  - [ ] JS template literals with `{{ script_name }}` inside backticks → flagged for manual review via `JS_TEMPLATE_LITERAL_RE` pre-pass
  - [ ] Bare `"/admin/..."` / `"/static/..."` string literals in quotes → flagged for manual review via `BARE_ADMIN_RE` post-pass
- [ ] Codemod runs to exit code 0 against all 72 templates in `/templates/`
- [ ] Codemod stdout reports `"72 templates processed, N transformations applied"`
- [ ] Codemod is idempotent: re-running on post-codemod templates yields zero diff
- [ ] `git diff --stat templates/` shows changes in ≥ 40 files
- [ ] `rg -n "url_for" templates/ | wc -l` ≥ 134 (did not drop references)
- [ ] Manual audit of tricky files — `add_product_gam.html` (15 `url_for` literals inside JS string literals), plus any other `§12.5` flagged files

**Tests created (Wave 0 additions):**

- [ ] `tests/unit/admin/test_templates_url_for_resolves.py` — AST-extracts every `url_for('name', ...)` from templates; asserts `name` in `{r.name for r in app.routes}`. Blocker 1 runtime safety net.
- [ ] `tests/unit/admin/test_templates_no_hardcoded_admin_paths.py` — Blocker 1 GREENFIELD guard. Forbids `script_name`/`script_root`/`admin_prefix`/`static_prefix` Jinja references AND bare `"/admin/"` / `"/static/"` string literals in quotes.
- [ ] `tests/unit/admin/test_architecture_admin_routes_named.py` — GREENFIELD: AST-scans `src/admin/routers/*.py`; every `@router.<method>(...)` decorator must have `name=` kwarg. Prerequisite for `url_for` coverage.
- [ ] `tests/unit/admin/test_codemod_idempotent.py` — GREENFIELD: running the template codemod twice produces no additional changes.
- [ ] `tests/unit/admin/test_oauth_callback_routes_exact_names.py` — Blocker 6 GREENFIELD enhancement: byte-pins OAuth callback route names AND paths together. Changing `/admin/auth/google/callback` name or path fails the test.
- [ ] `tests/unit/admin/test_trailing_slash_tolerance.py` — Blocker 2 guard
- [ ] `tests/unit/test_architecture_no_flask_imports.py` — empty allowlist check, ratchets per wave
- [ ] `tests/unit/test_architecture_handlers_use_sync_def.py` — v2.0 sync invariant guard (async pivot reversed 2026-04-12). Asserts every admin router handler is sync `def`, NOT `async def`. Replaces the wrong-direction `test_architecture_admin_routes_async.py`.
- [ ] `tests/unit/test_architecture_no_async_db_access.py` — v2.0 sync sibling guard. Asserts admin DB access uses sync `with get_db_session()`, NOT `async with` or `AsyncSession`.
- [ ] `tests/unit/test_architecture_handlers_use_annotated_depends.py` — Agent E idiom upgrade. AST-scans `src/admin/routers/*.py`; every `@router.<method>(...)` handler parameter must use `Annotated[T, ...]` form, not `x = Query(...)` default-value syntax.
- [ ] `tests/unit/test_architecture_templates_receive_dtos_not_orm.py` — Agent E idiom upgrade. Asserts every `render(request, "tpl", context)` call passes only primitives, Pydantic BaseModel instances, or the request object — never ORM model instances. Prevents lazy-load Risk #1 realization.
- [ ] ~~`tests/unit/test_architecture_no_sync_session_usage.py`~~ **[DEFERRED v2.1]** — was Agent E idiom upgrade for async. v2.0 USES sync `Session` and `sessionmaker` — this guard would fail against the intended v2.0 state.
- [ ] `tests/unit/test_architecture_no_module_level_engine.py` — Agent E idiom upgrade. Asserts no `create_async_engine` or `create_engine` at module scope — must be inside a function (lifespan factory). Prevents pytest-asyncio event-loop leak (Risk Interaction B).
- [ ] `tests/unit/test_architecture_no_direct_env_access.py` — Agent E idiom upgrade. Asserts no `os.environ.get` or `os.environ[` in `src/admin/` or `src/core/` except `src/core/settings.py` (the only file that reads env directly via pydantic-settings).
- [ ] `tests/unit/test_architecture_uses_structlog.py` — Agent E idiom upgrade. Asserts new `src/admin/` and `src/core/` files use `from src.core.logging import get_logger`, not `logging.getLogger(`. Allowlisted for existing files during migration.
- [ ] `tests/unit/test_architecture_repository_eager_loads.py` — Agent E idiom upgrade. Asserts every repository method whose DTO has nested-attribute returns has an `.options(selectinload(...))` call matching the nested relationships.
- [ ] `tests/unit/test_architecture_middleware_order.py` — Agent E idiom upgrade. Asserts the exact middleware registration order in `src/app.py` matches the documented runtime order (e.g., Approximated BEFORE CSRF per Blocker 5). Prevents reshuffling.
- [ ] ~~`tests/unit/test_architecture_tests_use_async_client.py`~~ **[DEFERRED v2.1]** — was Agent E idiom upgrade for async. v2.0 uses Starlette `TestClient` (sync) for admin tests.
- [ ] `tests/unit/test_architecture_exception_handlers_complete.py` — Agent E idiom upgrade. Scans `src/app.py` for `@app.exception_handler` decorators; asserts all 6 are registered (AdCPError, HTTPException, RequestValidationError, AdminRedirect, AdminAccessDenied, Exception).
- [ ] `tests/unit/test_architecture_csrf_exempt_covers_adcp.py` — first-order audit action #8a
- [ ] `tests/unit/test_architecture_approximated_middleware_path_gated.py` — first-order audit action #8b (also satisfies near-blocker #1)
- [ ] `tests/unit/test_architecture_admin_routes_excluded_from_openapi.py` — first-order audit action #8c
- [ ] `tests/unit/test_architecture_single_worker_invariant.py` — derivative guard (scheduler singleton protection)
- [ ] `tests/unit/test_architecture_harness_overrides_isolated.py` — derivative guard (`app.dependency_overrides` leakage protection)
- [ ] `tests/unit/test_architecture_scheduler_lifespan_composition.py` — NEW from apps inventory. AST-parses `src/app.py`, asserts `FastAPI(...)` has `lifespan=combine_lifespans(app_lifespan, mcp_app.lifespan)`. Prevents silent scheduler stop if MCP mount is dropped.
- [ ] `tests/unit/test_architecture_a2a_routes_grafted.py` — NEW from apps inventory. Walks `app.routes` and asserts `/a2a`, `/.well-known/agent-card.json`, `/agent.json` are top-level `Route` objects (NOT inside a `Mount`). Prevents future refactor from mounting A2A as a sub-app and breaking middleware propagation + `_replace_routes()`.
- [ ] `tests/unit/test_foundation_modules_import.py` — smoke test that every foundation module imports cleanly
- [ ] `tests/integration/test_schemas_discovery_external_contract.py` — contract test for `/schemas/adcp/v2.4/*` (first-order audit action #4)
- [ ] **(total Wave 0 structural guards = 16)**

**Harness extension:**

- [ ] `tests/harness/_base.py::IntegrationEnv.get_admin_client()` exists, added as sibling to `get_rest_client()` near line 914
- [ ] `get_admin_client()` snapshots `app.dependency_overrides` on `__enter__` and restores on `__exit__` (prevents test leakage per §3.3 deep audit)
- [ ] Smoke test: `python -c "from tests.harness import IntegrationEnv; ..."` succeeds (TestClient construction does not error against empty router)

**Blockers fixed in Wave 0:**

- [ ] Blocker 1 (script_root) — via codemod + `render()` wrapper + guard test
- [ ] Blocker 2 (trailing slash) — via `APIRouter(redirect_slashes=True)` default in `build_admin_router()`
- [ ] Blocker 4 (async session interleaving) — via full async SQLAlchemy pivot (Option A, 2026-04-11); Wave 0 adds the `test_architecture_admin_routes_async.py` guard + the lazy-loading audit spike. The full async conversion lands in Wave 4-5; the Wave 0 guard asserts the target-state handler signature is maintained from day one.

**What Wave 0 does NOT do (preserves mergeability):**

- [ ] `pyproject.toml` is unchanged
- [ ] `src/app.py` is unchanged (no middleware added, no router included)
- [ ] No Flask files deleted
- [ ] Flask catch-all still serving 100% of `/admin/*` traffic

**Exit criteria:**

- [ ] All 15 Wave-0 acceptance criteria in execution-details §Wave 0.A pass
- [ ] `make quality` green
- [ ] `tox -e integration` green
- [ ] `tox -e bdd` green
- [ ] `./run_all_tests.sh` green
- [ ] `python scripts/codemod_templates_greenfield.py --check templates/` returns exit 0 (idempotent re-run yields no diff) — enforced by `test_codemod_idempotent.py`
- [ ] Branch mergeable state verified
- [ ] Single squashed merge commit on `main`

### Wave 1 — Foundational routers + session cutover (~4,000 LOC)

> **Knowledge sources for this wave:**
> - `flask-to-fastapi-worked-examples.md` §4.1-4.3 — OAuth login/logout + favicon upload worked examples
> - `flask-to-fastapi-deep-audit.md` §1 — Blockers 3,5,6 fixed in Wave 1
> - `async-audit/frontend-deep-audit.md` §3 — OAuth + session + auth flow audit
> - `flask-to-fastapi-foundation-modules.md` §11.4 — deps/auth.py implementation
> - `flask_migration_critical_knowledge.md` items 2,4,5,6,17 — OIDC path, 307 default, CSRF unenforced, tojson, SameSite

**Entry criteria:**

- [ ] Wave 0 merged to `main`
- [ ] `SESSION_SECRET` live in staging secret store
- [ ] Playwright smoke run against the empty admin router confirms `get_admin_client()` infra is sound
- [ ] Authlib starlette_client happy-path spike completed on staging (assumption #8 verification from execution-details Part 2)

**Routers ported:**

- [ ] `src/admin/routers/public.py` (~400 LOC) — signup, landing, no-auth pages
- [ ] `src/admin/routers/core.py` (~600 LOC) — `/`, `/health`, dashboard
- [ ] `src/admin/routers/auth.py` (~1,100 LOC) — Google OAuth login flow via Authlib `starlette_client`
- [ ] `src/admin/routers/oidc.py` (~500 LOC) — per-tenant OIDC dynamic client registration

**Middleware stack wired in `src/app.py` in CORRECTED order (outermost → innermost):**

- [ ] 1. `CORSMiddleware` (already present)
- [ ] 2. `SessionMiddleware` (new, from `src/admin/sessions.py`)
- [ ] 3. `ApproximatedExternalDomainMiddleware` (new, BEFORE CSRF per Blocker 5)
- [ ] 4. `CSRFMiddleware` (new)
- [ ] 5. `RestCompatMiddleware` (already present)
- [ ] 6. `UnifiedAuthMiddleware` (already present)
- [ ] `tests/integration/test_middleware_ordering.py` exists and is green — inspects `app.user_middleware` and asserts the sequence

**Blockers fixed in Wave 1:**

- [ ] Blocker 3 (AdCPError HTML regression) — handler Accept-aware, `error.html` template exists, `test_admin_error_page.py` green
- [ ] Blocker 5 (middleware order) — swap applied, redirect is 307, `test_external_domain_post_redirects_before_csrf.py` green
- [ ] Blocker 6 (OAuth URI immutability) — guard test green AND a manual staging OAuth smoke test walked end-to-end against real Google with both OIDC tenants

**Foundation runtime verifications:**

- [ ] `GET /admin/login` serves from FastAPI, not Flask (curl + integration test)
- [ ] `POST /admin/auth/callback` completes a full redirect chain ending at `/admin/` with a fresh `adcp_session` cookie set by `SessionMiddleware`
- [ ] `GET /admin/health` serves from FastAPI; old Flask `/admin/health` commented out
- [ ] CSRF double-submit: `POST /admin/auth/logout` with valid session but no CSRF header returns 403; with valid session + matching cookie + header returns 303
- [ ] CSRF cookie generated on first GET of a page with a form
- [ ] `{{ csrf_token(request) }}` helper emits a token in hidden form field
- [ ] Session cookie cutover announcement sent to users before deploy
- [ ] Stale `session=...` cookie returns fresh login page (not an error); Playwright `login_with_stale_flask_cookie` test green
- [ ] `test_templates_url_for_resolves.py` runs in `--strict` mode — every `url_for("name")` in templates referenced by Wave 1 routers resolves to an actual registered endpoint

**Architecture guards update:**

- [ ] `test_architecture_no_flask_imports.py` allowlist shrunk — `public.py/core.py/auth.py/oidc.py` removed (forbid re-introducing Flask in migrated files)

**Dependency changes:**

- [ ] `pyproject.toml` adds ~~`sse-starlette>=2.2.0`,~~ **STALE — D8 DELETE: `sse-starlette` never added** `pydantic-settings>=2.7.0`, `itsdangerous>=2.2.0`

**Playwright smoke coverage (staging):**

- [ ] `tests/e2e/test_admin_login_flow.py` green — login → dashboard
- [ ] `tests/e2e/test_admin_csrf_enforcement.py` green

**Rollback infrastructure:**

- [ ] Rollback procedure tested in staging: revert commit, verify users forced through re-login, verify Flask catch-all re-serves all 4 migrated routes (because `register_blueprint` calls were commented out, not deleted)

**Exit criteria:**

- [ ] All 15 Wave-1 acceptance criteria in execution-details §Wave 1.A pass
- [ ] 4 new routers together have ≥ 90% branch coverage
- [ ] Zero Flask imports in `src/admin/routers/**`
- [ ] Staging deploy completes
- [ ] Manual login smoke test performed by 2 engineers against staging
- [ ] `make quality` + `tox -e integration` + `tox -e bdd` green
- [ ] Redirect assertion audit: pre-existing integration tests that asserted `response.status_code == 302` for login redirects updated to `303` (FastAPI `RedirectResponse` convention)
- [ ] Branch mergeable state verified

### Wave 2 — Bulk blueprint migration (~9,000 LOC)

- [ ] Wave 1 Playwright suite passing on staging nightly
- [ ] `scripts/check_coverage_parity.py` tested on Wave 1 and green

- [ ] All 22 blueprints have designated owner reviewers
- [ ] Team `src/admin/` freeze announcement sent 48h before PR opens
- [ ] Freeze scope confirmed: entire `src/admin/**` except `activity_stream.py`; whole `tests/integration/**` for anything touching deleted fixtures
- [ ] Branch-lifetime budget confirmed: ≤ 7 calendar days

**Routers ported — 22 HTML/JSON blueprints plus 3 top-level APIs (25 target files):**

- [ ] `src/admin/routers/accounts.py`
- [ ] `src/admin/routers/products.py` (2,464 LOC source — audit for surprises)
- [ ] `src/admin/routers/principals.py`
- [ ] `src/admin/routers/users.py`
- [ ] `src/admin/routers/tenants.py`
- [ ] `src/admin/routers/gam.py`
- [ ] `src/admin/routers/inventory.py`
- [ ] `src/admin/routers/inventory_profiles.py`
- [ ] `src/admin/routers/creatives.py` — webhook payload preservation audit
- [ ] `src/admin/routers/creative_agents.py`
- [ ] `src/admin/routers/signals_agents.py`
- [ ] `src/admin/routers/operations.py` — webhook payload preservation audit
- [ ] `src/admin/routers/policy.py`

- [ ] `src/admin/routers/authorized_properties.py`
- [ ] `src/admin/routers/publisher_partners.py`
- [ ] `src/admin/routers/workflows.py`
- [ ] `src/admin/routers/api.py` (7 routes — dashboard AJAX)
- [ ] `src/admin/routers/format_search.py` (4 routes)
- [ ] `src/admin/routers/schemas.py` (6 routes — EXTERNAL contract preserved)
- [ ] `src/admin/routers/tenant_management_api.py` (6 routes — Category 2)
- [ ] `src/admin/routers/sync_api.py` (9 routes, duplicate mount at `/api/sync` preserved)
- [ ] `src/admin/routers/gam_reporting_api.py` (6 routes — Category 1 session-authed)

**Dead code deleted:**

- [ ] `src/services/gam_inventory_service.py::create_inventory_endpoints` function body (early-return dead code at line 1469)
- [ ] `src/adapters/google_ad_manager.py::register_ui_routes` hook — content re-homed into `src/admin/routers/adapters.py`
- [ ] `src/adapters/mock_ad_server.py::register_ui_routes` hook — same

**Flask files deleted:**

- [ ] 21 blueprint files under `src/admin/blueprints/` (every file EXCEPT `activity_stream.py`)
- [ ] `src/admin/tenant_management_api.py`
- [ ] `src/admin/sync_api.py`
- [ ] `src/adapters/gam_reporting_api.py`

**Test files deleted:**

- [ ] 17 integration test files building Flask test apps (§5.8 blast radius)
- [ ] `tests/admin/test_accounts_blueprint.py`
- [ ] `tests/admin/test_product_creation_integration.py`
- [ ] `tests/admin/conftest.py::ui_client` and `authenticated_ui_client` fixtures
- [ ] `tests/integration/conftest.py::flask_client`, `authenticated_client`, `admin_client`, `test_admin_app`, `authenticated_admin_client` fixtures
- [ ] `tests/conftest.py::flask_app`, `flask_client`, `authenticated_client` fixtures (lines 596-635 per §5.3)

**Error-shape classification tests:**

- [ ] `tests/integration/test_category1_native_error_shape.py` — asserts `POST /admin/api/*` endpoints return `{"detail": "..."}` on 4xx
- [ ] `tests/integration/test_category2_compat_error_shape.py` — asserts `POST /api/v1/tenant-management/*` and `POST /api/v1/sync/*` return `{"success": false, "error": "..."}` on 4xx (byte-for-byte vs Wave 1 golden fixture)

**Category-1 error-shape classification covers:**

- [ ] `src/admin/routers/api.py` (7 routes) — native shape
- [ ] `src/admin/routers/format_search.py` (4 routes) — native shape
- [ ] `src/admin/routers/gam_reporting_api.py` (6 routes) — native shape (reclassified)
- [ ] `change_account_status` at `/admin/tenant/<tid>/accounts/<aid>/status` — native shape

**Category-2 scoped exception handler verified:**

- [ ] `_LEGACY_PATH_PREFIXES = ("/api/v1/tenant-management", "/api/v1/sync", "/api/sync")`
- [ ] Does NOT include `/api/v1/products`, `/api/v1/media-buys`, or any AdCP REST path
- [ ] Does NOT include `gam_reporting_api` (now Category 1)

**Wave 2 audit tasks:**

- [ ] `schemas.py` external contract test green (byte-identical shape, 404/500 body shape preserved)
- [ ] Webhook payload preservation manual code review performed — no `adcp.types.*` used as `response_model=` on any admin route
- [ ] `datetime` serialization format audit — every `jsonify({...})` call in `src/admin/routers/gam.py`, `inventory.py`, etc. explicitly `.isoformat()`s datetime values before serialization
- [ ] `scripts/check_coverage_parity.py` per-wave gate passed — new routers ≥ (old coverage − 1)

**Playwright admin flows green on staging:**

- [ ] Login → dashboard
- [ ] Create account
- [ ] Create product
- [ ] Delete product
- [ ] Logout
- [ ] Re-login

**Structural guards update:**

- [ ] `test_architecture_no_flask_imports.py` allowlist shrunk to 3 entries:
  - `src/admin/app.py`
  - `src/app.py`
  - `src/admin/blueprints/activity_stream.py`
- [ ] `src/admin/blueprints/` directory contains only `activity_stream.py`
- [ ] `git grep -l "flask" src/admin/` returns only `app.py` and `blueprints/activity_stream.py`
- [ ] `test_architecture_no_raw_select.py` allowlist naturally shrinks (admin files use repositories by design)

**Flask catch-all status:**

- [ ] Flask catch-all still wired at `src/app.py:299-304` as a safety net
- [ ] `tests/integration/test_flask_catchall_unreached.py` — asserts no request routes to the Flask mount during `./run_all_tests.sh`
- [ ] Flask catch-all receives zero requests in 24h of staging traffic (monitored)

**Operational verifications:**

- [ ] Datadog dashboards confirmed green by platform team
- [ ] No external consumer references Flask-era endpoints

**Exit criteria:**

- [ ] All 15 Wave-2 acceptance criteria in execution-details §Wave 2.A pass
- [ ] Branch lifetime ≤ 7 calendar days from open to merge (daily rebase)
- [ ] `make quality` + `tox -e integration` + `tox -e bdd` + `./run_all_tests.sh` green
- [ ] PR description includes blueprint-by-blueprint diff summary
- [ ] 3 reviewers assigned per area (HTML UI / JSON API / adapters)

### Wave 3 — ~~Activity stream SSE +~~ Cache migration + Flask cleanup cutover (~2,500 LOC)

> **Knowledge sources for this wave:**
> - `flask-to-fastapi-foundation-modules.md` §11.15 — SimpleAppCache implementation (Decision 6)
> - `flask-to-fastapi-execution-details.md` §Wave 3 — rollback procedure + proxy-header smoke tests
> - `flask-to-fastapi-migration.md` §15 — dependency changes
> - `flask_migration_critical_knowledge.md` items 7,10 — psycopg2 retained, SSE orphan

> **⚠️ STALE heading corrected 2026-04-11 (Decision 8 DELETE).** The SSE port was removed from Wave 3 scope. SSE route is deleted in Wave 4. Wave 3 now focuses on cache migration (Decision 6 SimpleAppCache) and Flask removal.

**Entry criteria:**

- [ ] Wave 2 merged to `main` and stable in staging ≥ 5 business days
- [ ] Flask catch-all receives zero traffic in staging for 48h
- [ ] Datadog/dashboard audit confirms no external consumer references Flask-era endpoints
- [ ] `v1.99.0` git tag created and container image archived in registry (rollback fallback)
- [ ] ~~SSE spike completed — disconnect detection validated behind Fly.io + nginx~~ **STALE — D8 DELETE: no SSE spike needed; route deleted in Wave 4**

> **~~Activity stream SSE port:~~** **STALE — D8 DELETE (2026-04-11): entire SSE port block below is void. The `/tenant/{id}/events` SSE route, generator, rate-limit state, HEAD probe, and `sse_starlette` dependency are deleted in Wave 4, not ported in Wave 3. The surviving `/activity` JSON poll route and `/activities` REST route convert mechanically to async in Wave 4. See Decision 8 in §1.2 and CLAUDE.md.**
>
> ~~- [ ] `src/admin/routers/activity_stream.py` (~400 LOC) exists using `sse_starlette.EventSourceResponse`~~
> ~~- [ ] `GET /admin/tenant/{tenant_id}/activity-stream` opens SSE~~

> ~~- [ ] `tests/integration/test_activity_stream_backpressure.py` green~~

**Dependency removals from `pyproject.toml`:**

- [ ] `flask>=3.1.3`
- [ ] `flask-caching>=2.3.0`
- [ ] `flask-socketio>=5.5.1`
- [ ] `python-socketio>=5.13.0`
- [ ] `simple-websocket>=1.1.0`
- [ ] `waitress>=3.0.0`
- [ ] `a2wsgi>=1.10.0`
- [ ] `types-waitress` (dev)
- [ ] `werkzeug` (if still pinned)
- [ ] `uv lock` or `poetry lock --check` succeeds post-removal

**Files deleted:**

- [ ] `src/admin/app.py` (427 LOC — old Flask factory)
- [ ] `src/admin/blueprints/activity_stream.py` (390 LOC)
- [ ] `src/admin/blueprints/` directory (now empty)
- [ ] `src/admin/server.py` (103 LOC — orphan standalone Flask server)
- [ ] `scripts/run_admin_ui.py` (references deleted `src/admin/server.py`)
- [ ] `src/admin/utils/helpers.py::require_auth` (dead after all callers migrated)
- [ ] `src/admin/utils/helpers.py::require_tenant_access` (dead)
- [ ] `tests/admin/conftest.py` (legacy fixtures)

**Files modified in `src/app.py`:**

- [ ] `_install_admin_mounts()` function deleted (lines 25-45)
- [ ] `flask_admin_app = create_app()` / `admin_wsgi = WSGIMiddleware(...)` deleted
- [ ] Flask mount at `src/app.py:299-304` deleted
- [ ] `/a2a/` trailing-slash redirect deleted (src/app.py:127-135)
- [ ] `app.router.routes.insert(0, Route("/", ...))` landing hack deleted (src/app.py:351-352)
- [ ] `CustomProxyFix` references removed
- [ ] 17 `noqa: E402` carve-outs cleaned up
- [ ] Uvicorn invocation in `scripts/run_server.py` uses `--proxy-headers --forwarded-allow-ips='*'`
- [ ] `FlyHeadersMiddleware` retained OR deleted per assumption #21 verification

**Pre-commit + CI:**

- [ ] `.pre-commit-hooks/check_route_conflicts.py` rewritten for FastAPI — scans `app.routes` introspection, not Flask URL map
- [ ] Rewritten hook has unit test against known-conflicting fixture
- [ ] Rewritten hook passes on current main

**Template and static file moves (`git mv` preserves history):**

- [ ] `/templates/` → `src/admin/templates/`
- [ ] `/static/` → `src/admin/static/`
- [ ] `Jinja2Templates(directory=...)` singleton in `src/admin/templating.py` points to new path
- [ ] `StaticFiles` mount at `src/app.py` points to `src/admin/static/`

**Architecture guards final state:**

- [ ] `test_architecture_no_flask_imports.py` allowlist is EMPTY
- [ ] `rg -w flask src/` returns zero hits
- [ ] `rg 'from flask' tests/` returns zero hits
- [ ] `rg 'a2wsgi\|werkzeug\|waitress\|flask_caching\|flask_socketio' src/` returns zero hits

**Release engineering:**

- [ ] `CHANGELOG.md` v2.0.0 entry written with breaking changes:
  - Dependency removal list
  - `FLASK_SECRET_KEY` → `SESSION_SECRET` (dual-read in v2.0)
  - Session cookie rename `session` → `adcp_session` (forced re-login)
  - Error-shape split (Category 1 native / Category 2 compat)
  - CSRF required on form POSTs
  - Admin router not exposed in `/openapi.json`
  - Redirect status changes 302 → 307 for external-domain redirect
- [ ] `CHANGELOG.md` references `flask-to-fastapi-migration.md` §15 (deps) and §19 (flow changes)
- [ ] Docker image build completes
- [ ] Docker image size delta measured — target ≥ 60 MB reduction vs Wave 2
- [ ] Playwright full regression suite green against staging v2.0.0 build
- [ ] Production deploy plan approved
- [ ] Production smoke test plan drafted: deploy → login → create tenant → create product → submit creative → ~~SSE activity stream visible~~ **JSON poll `/activity` returns recent events (D8 DELETE)** → logout

**Proxy-header smoke tests (Wave 3 pre-deploy — CRITICAL):**

The Flask removal also removes Flask's internal WSGI proxy-header stack (`CustomProxyFix`, `FlyHeadersMiddleware`, werkzeug `ProxyFix` at `src/admin/app.py:187-194`). These rewrote `Fly-Forwarded-Proto` → `X-Forwarded-Proto` and handled `X-Script-Name` for reverse-proxy deployments. Their replacement is `uvicorn --proxy-headers --forwarded-allow-ips='*'` (deep audit §R4 / §2.5). If this replacement fails, `request.url.scheme` returns `http` instead of `https` in production, which breaks OAuth by producing `redirect_uri=http%3A%2F%2F...` that Google Cloud Console rejects with `redirect_uri_mismatch` → **login is dead in production.**

- [ ] `scripts/run_server.py` launches uvicorn with `--proxy-headers --forwarded-allow-ips='*'` (verified in the file)
- [ ] Staging deploy of Wave 3 build
- [ ] `curl -sI https://staging-tenant.scope3.com/admin/login` — verify `Location:` header (if redirect) contains `https://`, not `http://`
- [ ] `curl -sI 'https://staging-tenant.scope3.com/admin/auth/google/initiate'` — verify the OAuth-initiation response's `Location:` header contains `redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2F...` (URL-encoded `https://`). If it contains `redirect_uri=http%3A%2F%2F...`, `--proxy-headers` is not reading `X-Forwarded-Proto` correctly and OAuth will fail with `redirect_uri_mismatch`. **STOP deployment and fix before proceeding.**
- [ ] Manual browser test: click "Log in" on staging, verify the browser arrives at a real Google OAuth consent page (not an error page). Complete the OAuth flow; verify the callback lands on `https://staging-tenant.scope3.com/admin/...` and the admin UI loads.
- [ ] If `FlyHeadersMiddleware` was kept (assumption #21 deferred): verify Fly-specific header rewriting still works by checking `scope["headers"]` logs in staging for requests carrying `Apx-Incoming-Host`.

**Exit criteria:**

- [ ] All 15 Wave-3 acceptance criteria in execution-details §Wave 3.A pass
- [ ] `rg -w flask .` from repo root returns zero hits
- [ ] ~~`v2.0.0` git tag applied~~ **(MOVED TO Wave 5 under the async pivot 2026-04-11; Wave 3 merges but v2.0.0 tag waits until Waves 4-5 land)**
- [ ] Staging canary runs 48h without incident
- [ ] Wave 3 merges to `main`; Waves 4-5 continue the async DB layer absorption

### Wave 4 — ~~Async database layer~~ DEFERRED TO v2.1 (async pivot reversed 2026-04-12)

> **This entire wave is v2.1 scope.** v2.0 ships with sync handlers and sync SQLAlchemy. Do not implement anything in this section for v2.0. The async-audit reports in `async-audit/` contain the research for when this work begins in v2.1.

**Entry criteria:**

- [ ] Wave 3 merged to `main` and stable in staging ≥ 3 business days
- [ ] Pre-Wave-0 lazy-loading audit spike outcome approved (see Section 1.1)
- [ ] Pre-Wave-0 async driver compatibility spike outcome approved (see Section 1.1)
- [ ] `v1.99.0` git tag remains as the Flask-era rollback fallback

**Core DB layer conversion (Agent A scope inventory governs this list):**

- [ ] `src/core/database/database_session.py` rewrite:
  - [ ] `create_engine` → `create_async_engine` (with `postgresql://` → `postgresql+asyncpg://` URL rewriter)
  - [ ] `scoped_session(sessionmaker(...))` → `async_sessionmaker(_engine, class_=AsyncSession, expire_on_commit=False, autoflush=False)`
  - [ ] `get_db_session()` becomes `@asynccontextmanager async def` yielding `AsyncSession`
  - [ ] Engine is lifespan-scoped (not module-level) per Agent E Category 1 guidance — created in `database_lifespan(app)` and stored on `app.state.db_engine`
  - [ ] `SessionDep = Annotated[AsyncSession, Depends(get_session)]` defined in `src/core/database/deps.py`
- [ ] ~~`alembic/env.py` rewrite~~ **ELIMINATED per DB-4: `env.py` stays sync with psycopg2.** Spike 6 reduced to `render_item` hook + advisory lock (~0.5 day). See Section 1.1 correction.
- [ ] All repository classes converted to `async def` methods with `(await session.execute(select(...))).scalars().first()` pattern
- [ ] UoW classes either converted to `async def __aenter__` / `async def __aexit__` OR deleted in favor of `SessionDep` + per-repository Dep factories (Agent E preferred: FastAPI's request-scoped session IS the unit of work)
- [ ] All `src/core/tools/*.py` `_impl` functions converted to `async def` (several already are per Agent D Section 1.3 inventory)
- [ ] All `*_raw` wrapper functions in `src/core/tools/*.py` converted to `async def`
- [ ] Remaining sync `with get_db_session()` call sites in `src/admin/` and `src/core/` converted to `async with`

**Agent D mitigations (AdCP wire-safety — MUST land in Wave 4):**

- [ ] **M1.** Add 8 missing `await` keywords in `src/routes/api_v1.py` (lines 200, 214, 252, 284, 305, 324, 342, 360) — each is a 1-character insertion
- [ ] **M2.** Add 2 missing `await` keywords in `src/core/tools/capabilities.py` (lines 265, 310)
- [ ] **M3.** Convert sync `_raw` functions to `async def` (same as bullet above; Agent D M3 is a cross-ref to Agent A scope)
- [ ] **M4.** `tests/unit/test_api_v1_routes_await_all_impls.py` — AST-walks `src/routes/api_v1.py`, asserts every `_raw`/`_impl` call site is `await`-prefixed when the target is async def. Prevents M1/M2 regression.
- [ ] **M5.** `tests/integration/test_get_media_buys_wire_datetime_present.py` — creates a media buy without explicit `created_at`, fetches via `get_media_buys`, asserts `created_at` is not None in the wire response. Guards against the INSERT path relying on post-commit server_default read.
- [ ] **M6.** `tests/unit/test_architecture_no_server_default_without_refresh.py` — AST-parses `src/core/database/models.py`, finds every `server_default=`, fails if there's no `# NOQA: server-default-refreshed` comment or parallel ORM `default=`.
- [ ] **M7.** Migrate `server_default=func.now()` → `default=datetime.utcnow` for columns whose instances are read post-INSERT (`Creative.created_at`, `Creative.updated_at`, `MediaBuy.created_at`, `MediaBuy.updated_at`).
- [ ] **M8.** `tests/unit/test_architecture_adcp_datetime_nullability.py` — asserts `GetMediaBuysMediaBuy.created_at` and `updated_at` remain `datetime | None`. Prevents schema tightening.
- [ ] **M9.** `tests/unit/test_openapi_byte_stability.py` — snapshots `app.openapi()` to a committed JSON under `tests/unit/fixtures/openapi_snapshot.json`; CI asserts the OpenAPI spec matches. Catches unintended schema drift.

**Test harness conversion:**

- [ ] `tests/harness/_base.py::IntegrationEnv` converts to `async def __aenter__` / `async def __aexit__`
- [ ] `factory_boy` adapter chosen from the three options in `async-pivot-checkpoint.md` §3 (Agent E recommendation: option B — custom `AsyncSQLAlchemyModelFactory` wrapper)
- [ ] Integration tests mass-converted to `async def` + `@pytest.mark.asyncio` (scriptable via AST transform)
- [ ] Test harness switches from sync `TestClient(app)` to `httpx.AsyncClient(transport=ASGITransport(app=app))` with `app.dependency_overrides[get_session]` pattern (Agent E Category 14)
- [ ] Per-test engine fixture (function-scoped) + per-test session fixture to prevent event-loop leak

**Pool + connection tuning:**

- [ ] Connection pool `pool_size` bumped to match or exceed pre-migration sync threadpool capacity (Risk #6)
- [ ] `pool_pre_ping=True` and `pool_recycle=3600` set to handle Fly.io network blips and 2h idle kill
- [ ] `DB_POOL_SIZE` + `DB_POOL_MAX_OVERFLOW` env vars documented with production-safe defaults

**Wave 4 — Tooling gate (Agent F findings):**

In addition to the code conversion work:

- [ ] `check_database_health()` in `scripts/deploy/run_all_services.py` rewritten or deleted (F3.5.1)
- [ ] `check_schema_issues()` in `scripts/deploy/run_all_services.py` rewritten (F3.5.2)
- [ ] `init_database()` in `scripts/deploy/run_all_services.py` audited for async safety (F3.5.3)
- [ ] `scripts/deploy/entrypoint_admin.sh` psycopg2 probe rewritten or script deleted (F3.6.1)
- [ ] `Dockerfile` `libpq-dev` / `libpq5` removal (F1.2.1, F3.1.1)
- [ ] `docker-compose*.yml` DATABASE_URL compatibility verified (F3.2.1, F3.3.1, F3.4.1)
- [ ] New structural guards for admin routes async (F6.2.2), async DB access (F6.2.3), templates no ORM (F6.2.4) landed
- [ ] `tox -e driver-compat` env added and runs in CI (F2.1.2, F2.4.5)
- [ ] `/health/pool` + `/metrics` endpoints added (F4.1.1, F4.1.3)
- [ ] DB pool Prometheus gauges added (F4.1.4)
- [ ] `contextvars` request-ID propagation landed (F4.3.1)
- [ ] CLAUDE.md + `/docs` async updates complete (F5.1.*, F5.2.*)
- [ ] All 5 scripts with top-level `database_session` imports audited for Risk #33 (F7.3.1)

**Wave 4 exit criteria:**

- [ ] All tests converted and green: `tox -e unit`, `tox -e integration`, `tox -e bdd`, `tox -e e2e`, `tox -e admin`
- [ ] Agent D M1-M9 mitigations all landed and green
- [ ] OpenAPI snapshot matches (M9 guard)
- [ ] `/health/db` and `/health/schedulers` endpoints return healthy
- [ ] Staging deploy completes with zero 500s on hot admin routes for 24h

### Wave 5 — ~~Async cleanup + v2.0.0 release~~ DEFERRED TO v2.1 (async pivot reversed 2026-04-12)

> **This entire wave is v2.1 scope.** v2.0.0 release happens at the end of Phase 3 (Flask removal). See `execution-plan.md`.

> **Knowledge sources for this wave:**
> - `async-audit/agent-e-ideal-state-gaps.md` — remaining idiom upgrades deferred to v2.1
> - `async-audit/agent-f-nonsurface-inventory.md` — non-code action items (docs, CI, Dockerfile)
> - `implementation-checklist.md` §6-7 — post-migration verification + planning artifact cleanup

**Entry criteria:**

- [ ] Wave 4 merged to `main` and stable in staging ≥ 3 business days

**Async-vs-sync benchmark:**

- [ ] Async vs pre-migration sync baseline benchmark run on representative admin routes (read-heavy `GET /admin/tenant/t1/products` + write-heavy `POST /admin/tenant/t1/accounts`)
- [ ] Latency profile is net-neutral to ~5% improvement under moderate concurrency (Risk #10)
- [ ] If regression: tune `pool_size` (Risk #6) first; `selectinload` eager-loading second; last resort fallback is to revert and defer async to v2.1

**Startup + observability:**

- [ ] Startup log assertion: schedulers (`delivery_webhook`, `media_buy_status`) report "alive" on first tick
- [ ] `/health/pool` exposes SQLAlchemy AsyncEngine pool stats (size, checked_in, checked_out, overflow)
- [ ] `/health/schedulers` returns alive-tick timestamps for each scheduler task

**Consequence audit (Risk #5):**

- [ ] `created_at` / `updated_at` post-commit access sites audited — `expire_on_commit=False` means these fields are not refreshed after commit; any code reading them post-commit without explicit `await session.refresh(obj)` must be fixed

**Wave 5 — Tooling polish (Agent F findings):**

- [ ] `.duplication-baseline` ratcheted back to ≤ Wave 4 start level (F7.4.2)
- [ ] Benchmark comparison CI job passing (F2.4.6, F8.4.1)
- [ ] `pyproject.toml` version bumped to 2.0.0 (F8.4.2)
- [ ] FIXME comments for async landmines closed (F7.5.2)
- [ ] Auto-memory `flask_to_fastapi_migration_v2.md` updated to reflect pivot (F7.6.1)
- [ ] Release notes include: driver swap, new env vars, new endpoints, new guards

**v2.0.0 release:**

- [ ] `CHANGELOG.md` v2.0.0 entry includes async pivot breaking changes: `psycopg2-binary` → `asyncpg`, `expire_on_commit=False` default, async handler signatures, async repository methods, async test harness
- [ ] `v2.0.0` git tag applied
- [ ] Production deploy plan approved
- [ ] Production deploy completes

---

## Section 5 — Rollback triggers and procedures

Full detail in `flask-to-fastapi-execution-details.md` §D under each wave.

### Rollback triggers per wave

- [ ] **Wave 0**: any failure of `make quality` post-merge; any templates regression found in Wave 1 entry check
- [ ] **Wave 1**: OAuth login broken in staging/prod; session cookie causes auth loop; CSRF middleware blocks POST form flows; middleware ordering causes 403s on external-domain POSTs
- [ ] **Wave 2**: any migrated admin route returns 500 against production traffic; Datadog dashboard loss; category-2 error shape regression caught by external consumer; coverage parity check fails
- [ ] **Wave 3**: uvicorn `--proxy-headers` fails to produce correct `https` scheme in production; ~~SSE disconnect detection fails in production~~ **STALE — D8 DELETE**; dependency lockfile resolution produces incompatible tree

### Wave 0 rollback procedure

Wave 0 is **pure addition** — nothing changes behavior. Single-commit revert.

- [ ] `git checkout main`
- [ ] `git revert -m 1 <wave-0-merge-sha>`
- [ ] `git push origin main`
- [ ] Verify `make quality` green on post-revert main
- [ ] No database state to restore, no env vars to roll back

### Wave 1 rollback procedure

Single-commit revert works. Users get one EXTRA forced re-login (in addition to the one Wave 1 already caused).

- [ ] `git checkout main`
- [ ] `git revert -m 1 <wave-1-merge-sha>`
- [ ] `git push origin main`
- [ ] Verify `register_blueprint` calls in `src/admin/app.py` auto-restored (they were commented out, not deleted)
- [ ] Verify `SESSION_SECRET` can remain set — Flask ignores it, no harm
- [ ] Document forced re-login in revert PR description
- [ ] No database state to restore

### Wave 2 rollback procedure

Single-commit revert; largest revert commit. Flask catch-all re-activates.

- [ ] `git checkout main`
- [ ] `git revert -m 1 <wave-2-merge-sha> --no-edit`
- [ ] `git diff HEAD~1 --stat | head -30` — verify 25+ files restored
- [ ] `git push origin main`
- [ ] Verify Flask catch-all at `src/app.py:299-304` is still live
- [ ] **Partial rollback option**: if only ONE router broke, revert just that file + its tests + re-add `register_blueprint(<bp>)` to `src/admin/app.py`, leaving the rest of Wave 2 intact
- [ ] Rollback window is open only until Wave 3 merges

### Wave 3 rollback procedure

**This is the dangerous cutover.** Wave 3 cannot roll back piecemeal.

- [ ] `git checkout main`
- [ ] `git revert -m 1 <wave-3-merge-sha> --no-edit`
- [ ] `cat pyproject.toml | grep -A 2 flask` — verify Flask deps restored
- [ ] `uv lock` — rebuild lockfile
- [ ] `docker build .` — rebuild image
- [ ] `grep -n "flask_admin_app\|admin_wsgi\|_install_admin_mounts" src/app.py` — verify Flask catch-all restored
- [ ] **Fallback option** (if git revert is too risky): redeploy the archived `v1.99.0` container image from the registry, accept downtime
- [ ] Rollback window is open until Wave 4 (the async SQLAlchemy conversion within v2.0) merges; after Wave 4, rollback becomes effectively impossible (driver has switched to asyncpg and async deps have spread through the codebase). Pivoted 2026-04-11 — async SQLAlchemy is no longer a separate v2.1 PR; it's absorbed as Wave 4-5 of v2.0.

---

## Section 6 — Post-migration verification (run after Wave 3 merges)

- [ ] Production traffic monitoring for 48 hours
- [ ] Error rate comparison vs pre-migration baseline (Datadog / logs)
- [ ] Admin UI latency p50 comparison vs pre-migration baseline
- [ ] Admin UI latency p99 comparison vs pre-migration baseline
- [ ] Docker image size delta reported to team (expected ~60-75 MB reduction — psycopg2 + libpq retained per D1/D2/D9)
- [ ] No 5xx spike in first 24h post-deploy
- [ ] ~~SSE activity stream connection count stable~~ **STALE — D8 DELETE: no SSE post-migration. Monitor JSON poll `/activity` response time instead.**
- [ ] `SESSION_SECRET` cookie size observed < 3.5 KB across all real users
- [x] ~~v2.1 async SQLAlchemy migration scoping kickoff scheduled~~ — Async SQLAlchemy already merged as Wave 4-5 of v2.0 (pivoted 2026-04-11 — no separate v2.1 kickoff needed)
- [ ] v2.1 nginx removal scoping kickoff scheduled
- [ ] v2.1 REST routes `Annotated[T, Depends()]` ratchet scoping kickoff scheduled
- [ ] v2.1 `FLASK_SECRET_KEY` dual-read removal scoping kickoff scheduled
- [ ] v2.1 `Apx-Incoming-Host` IP allowlist (security hardening) ticket filed
- [ ] v2.1 `require_tenant_access` `is_active` pre-existing-bug fix confirmed (Wave 0 tenant dep already fixed it; v2.1 deletes the dead Flask helper)
- [ ] v2.1 `/_internal/reset-db-pool` auth hardening ticket filed
- [ ] v2.2 multi-worker scheduler lease design ticket filed
- [ ] All 6 companion notes files archived to `.claude/notes/archive/flask-to-fastapi/` OR retained as historical reference (see Section 7)
- [ ] `feat/v2.0.0-flask-to-fastapi` branch deleted after successful merge + 1 week
- [ ] Auto-memory `flask-to-fastapi-migration-v2` entry marked complete

---

## Section 7 — Planning artifact cleanup after migration complete

Run this section only after v2.0.0 has been stable in production for ≥ 2 weeks.

- [ ] `.claude/notes/flask-to-fastapi/flask-to-fastapi-migration.md` — decide: archive to `.claude/notes/archive/flask-to-fastapi/` OR delete
- [ ] `.claude/notes/flask-to-fastapi/flask-to-fastapi-execution-details.md` — archive or delete
- [ ] `.claude/notes/flask-to-fastapi/flask-to-fastapi-foundation-modules.md` — archive or delete
- [ ] `.claude/notes/flask-to-fastapi/flask-to-fastapi-worked-examples.md` — archive or delete
- [ ] `.claude/notes/flask-to-fastapi/flask-to-fastapi-adcp-safety.md` — archive or delete
- [ ] `.claude/notes/flask-to-fastapi/flask-to-fastapi-deep-audit.md` — archive or delete
- [ ] `.claude/notes/flask-to-fastapi/implementation-checklist.md` (this file) — archive or delete
- [ ] Auto-memory entry `flask-to-fastapi-migration-v2` — remove
- [ ] Project `CLAUDE.md` "active migration" breadcrumb — remove
- [ ] `feat/v2.0.0-flask-to-fastapi` branch — delete after merge + stability window
- [ ] `v1.99.0` container image in registry — retention window 30 days, then prune
- [ ] `.duplication-baseline` — regenerate against new admin LOC footprint

---

## Section 8 — Known tech debt explicitly deferred to v2.1+

These items are **intentionally NOT in scope for v2.0**. They are referenced here so nothing is forgotten. Full detail in `flask-to-fastapi-deep-audit.md` Section 7 table.

### v2.1 scope (follow-on PR after v2.0 stabilizes)

- [x] ~~**Async SQLAlchemy**~~ **MOVED TO v2.0 Waves 4-5** (pivoted 2026-04-11) — convert `create_engine` → `create_async_engine`, `Session` → `AsyncSession`, all repositories to `async def`, ~100+ files affected. Detail: `async-pivot-checkpoint.md` §3 for target state; `flask-to-fastapi-migration.md` §18 (rewritten) for wave execution; deep audit §1.4 (rewritten) for Option A rationale.
- [ ] **Drop nginx entirely** — ~30 MB image savings; uvicorn `--proxy-headers` + tiny Starlette middleware covers all nginx responsibilities. Detail: `flask-to-fastapi-deep-audit.md` §4.1.
- [ ] **Ratchet REST routes to `Annotated[T, Depends()]`** — 14 route signatures in `src/routes/api_v1.py` currently use `= resolve_auth` default-value style. Add guard `test_architecture_rest_uses_annotated.py`. Detail: `flask-to-fastapi-deep-audit.md` §4.2.
- [ ] **Remove `FLASK_SECRET_KEY` dual-read** — remove fallback from `src/admin/sessions.py`, remove from `scripts/setup-dev.py`, `docker-compose.yml`, `docs/deployment/environment-variables.md`, `docs/development/troubleshooting.md`, update `tests/unit/test_setup_dev.py` (9 occurrences)
- [ ] **`/_internal/reset-db-pool` auth hardening** — pre-existing weakness; endpoint is only env-var gated (`ADCP_TESTING=true`). Detail: `flask-to-fastapi-deep-audit.md` §7 R9.
- [ ] **`require_tenant_access` `is_active` check** — pre-existing latent bug in Flask (Wave 0 `CurrentTenantDep` already filters `is_active=True`; v2.1 cleans up the dead Flask helper)
- [ ] **Structured logging (structlog / logfire) swap-in** — clean integration now that Flask is gone; `logfire` already in deps. Detail: `flask-to-fastapi-deep-audit.md` §4 opportunity list.

### v2.2 scope (requires additional design)

- [ ] **Multi-worker scheduler lease design** — today's webhook and media-buy-status schedulers are single-worker singletons. Multi-worker requires Postgres advisory lock OR separate scheduler container. Detail: `flask-to-fastapi-deep-audit.md` §3.1.
- [ ] ~~**SSE per-tenant rate limit moved to Redis**~~ **STALE — D8 DELETE: SSE route and `connection_counts` deleted in Wave 4. No Redis migration needed.**
- [ ] **`Apx-Incoming-Host` IP allowlist** — security hardening for the Approximated external-domain middleware. No client-side spoofing today because Fly.io terminates externally, but explicit allowlist is defensive. Detail: `flask-to-fastapi-deep-audit.md` §7 Y8.
