## Summary

The `tests/bdd/` harness parametrizes every scenario across four transports
(`impl`, `a2a`, `mcp`, `rest`) but dispatches most of them by calling the
`_impl` function (or a transport wrapper) **directly** from a per-use-case
`Env`. Several AdCP behaviors do **not** live in `_impl` — they live at the
**transport boundary** (the MCP/A2A/REST wrappers) or in the **protocol
envelope**. When the harness calls `_impl` directly, or when its transport
methods drop/transform fields, those behaviors are never exercised, so the
scenarios that assert them cannot pass on any transport.

This is the structural reason a family of UC-002 and UC-003 BDD scenarios were
"0 passing" despite having correct step definitions.

## Problem

Boundary/resolution logic that the scenarios assert but the harness bypasses:

| Behavior | Where it actually runs | Why the harness misses it |
|----------|------------------------|---------------------------|
| **Account resolution** (`ACCOUNT_NOT_FOUND`) | Transport wrappers: `create_media_buy_raw` (`src/core/tools/media_buy_create.py:3927`) and the MCP wrapper (`:4004`) call `enrich_identity_with_account` → `resolve_account` (`src/core/transport_helpers.py:106`). | `_create_media_buy_impl` does **not** resolve/enrich (`src/core/tools/media_buy_create.py:1533+` has no `enrich`/`resolve_account`). `MediaBuyCreateEnv.call_impl` calls `_impl` directly; `call_a2a`/`call_mcp` **strip** the `account` field (`flat.pop("account")`) because the flat `*_raw` wrappers don't accept it. So no transport surfaces account-not-found — the request proceeds to product validation and returns `SERVICE_UNAVAILABLE`. |
| **Update dispatch** | `_update_media_buy_impl` / `update_media_buy_raw` / MCP / REST update endpoint. | The UC-003 extension conftest branch ran scenarios through `MediaBuyCreateEnv`, whose `call_*` dispatch to the **create** path. An `UpdateMediaBuyRequest` hit `_create_media_buy_impl` → `AttributeError: 'UpdateMediaBuyRequest' object has no attribute 'get_total_budget'`. **(FIXED — see below.)** |
| **Protocol status** (`TaskStatus="completed"` on success) | `ProtocolEnvelope.wrap(payload, status=...)` (`src/core/protocol_envelope.py:113`), added by MCP/A2A/REST. | The harness captures the **domain** response (`UpdateMediaBuySuccess`, whose `status` is `None` at impl; create carries `MediaBuyStatus`, a *different* notion). `_update_media_buy_impl` never sets `status` on its success responses (`media_buy_update.py:359/383/532/1229`). `then_success.py:then_response_status` sees `status` in `model_fields` and asserts `None == "completed"`. |
| **REST update body** | `PUT /api/v1/media-buys/{id}`. | `MediaBuyDualEnv._build_update_rest_body` drops `packages`, so production returns `VALIDATION_ERROR: must include at least one updatable field`. |

### Concrete impact (at investigation time)

- `tests/bdd/test_uc003_update_media_buy.py`: **0** passing before the fix
  (all 30 baseline passers were UC-002); the 30 UC-002 passers were all error
  scenarios that don't need boundary resolution.
- `tests/bdd/test_uc002_create_media_buy.py`: `account_not_found` scenarios
  (rkb9) produce `SERVICE_UNAVAILABLE`, never `ACCOUNT_NOT_FOUND`.

## What landed (commit `c8849dd8a`)

UC-003 **update dispatch** is now wired:

- The UC-003 extension conftest branch (`tests/bdd/conftest.py`) uses
  `MediaBuyDualEnv` (`tests/harness/media_buy_dual.py`) instead of
  `MediaBuyCreateEnv`. `MediaBuyDualEnv` detects `UpdateMediaBuyRequest` and
  routes through the update wrappers across all four transports, against the
  real DB.
- `tests/factories/core.py::set_adapter_test_behavior(env, tenant_id, **behavior)`
  added (was imported by steps but never written → `ImportError`). Upserts
  `AdapterConfig.config_json["test_behavior"]` (read by
  `mock_ad_server._read_test_behavior`, `src/adapters/mock_ad_server.py:270`)
  and `mock_manual_approval_required`.
- `MediaBuyCreateEnv._build_mock_context_manager` (`tests/harness/media_buy_create.py`)
  now stubs `get_or_create_context` (used by the async update path) delegating
  to the real manager, so the persisted `context_id` is a real string
  (was: `psycopg2 can't adapt MagicMock` on the `workflow_steps` insert).
- `MediaBuyDualEnv._call_update_mcp` makes the mock `ctx.get_state` key-aware so
  `get_state("context_id")` returns `None` rather than the `ResolvedIdentity`
  (was: `psycopg2 can't adapt ResolvedIdentity`).

Result: `uc003` 0 → 4 passing, **0 regressions**, `make quality` green.

## Solution architecture (remaining work)

The guiding principle: **the harness must exercise the same boundary/resolution
path a real client would**, per transport — not call `_impl` directly when the
behavior under test lives at the boundary. Two complementary mechanisms:

1. **Env-level transport methods that mirror the boundary.** This is the
   `MediaBuyDualEnv` pattern: each `call_*` method runs the real wrapper /
   resolution for that transport. Extend the same pattern to account
   resolution in the create envs.
2. **Capture the protocol envelope, not just the domain payload.** Transports
   that wrap (`a2a`/`mcp`/`rest`) must surface `ProtocolEnvelope.status` so
   success scenarios can assert `TaskStatus`. `impl` has no envelope by
   definition (see Decision D2).

### Work areas

- **A. UC-003 success protocol-status semantics** (cross-cutting; shared with
  create). Decide where success `TaskStatus="completed"` is observed and make
  the harness/step honor it across transports. See Decision **D2**.
- **B. UC-003 REST update body** — fix `MediaBuyDualEnv._build_update_rest_body`
  so package updates survive to `PUT /api/v1/media-buys/{id}`.
- **C. UC-003 mcp/rest update error-path capture** — error scenarios pass on
  `impl`/`a2a` but still fail on `mcp`/`rest` (e.g. `budget_validation`), so the
  update error envelope isn't captured on those transports yet.
- **D. UC-002 create account-resolution across transports** (rkb9's real fix) —
  make the create envs exercise `enrich_identity_with_account`/`resolve_account`
  for each transport. Requires the flat `*_raw`/MCP wrappers to accept an
  `account` reference (today they don't), then un-strip it in
  `MediaBuyCreateEnv.call_a2a`/`call_mcp` and enrich in `call_impl`.
- **E. Parser/leaf fixes** (necessary but not sufficient on their own):
  - et3g: accept `invoice_recipient` in the update-field datatable parser
    (`tests/bdd/steps/domain/uc003_update_media_buy.py:235`).
  - 18eq: accept `product_id` in the package datatable parser (`:301`).
  - d61o: handle the `new_packages` `update_fields` pattern (`:1905`).
  Each then asserts a production rejection
  (`VALIDATION_ERROR`/`INVALID_REQUEST`/`UNSUPPORTED_FEATURE` + `suggestion`)
  across all four transports — which depends on C.

## Decisions

### D1 — Wire UC-003 update dispatch via `MediaBuyDualEnv` (DECIDED, landed)

The UC-003 extension scenarios run on `MediaBuyDualEnv`, which routes
`UpdateMediaBuyRequest` through the update wrappers per transport against the
real DB. Rationale: the env already existed for UC-026 (create-then-update) and
keeps update routing in one place instead of duplicating dispatch logic in the
When step. Consequence: all UC-003 ext scenarios now execute the update flow;
the dead duplicate `elif uc == "UC-003"` branches were removed.

### D2 — Success status is the protocol-envelope `TaskStatus`, REQUIRED on every response (RESOLVED via spec)

**Authoritative ref:** the pinned 3.1 derivation commit `04f59d2d5`
(tag `v3.1-04f59d2d5`, 2026-05-13) — the same commit the BR feature files stamp
in their `@source` lines. **Not** `v3.1.0-beta.3`, which is 226 commits *ahead*
and contains late-3.1 changes our derivation does not (see "Ref hazard" below).

**Spec findings (verified at `04f59d2d5`):**
- `core/protocol-envelope.json` declares `status` (`$ref enums/task-status.json`)
  and lists it in `required` (`["status", "payload"]`). Examples show
  `status: "completed"` (sync) / `"submitted"` / `"input-required"`. So the
  envelope `status` (TaskStatus) is REQUIRED on every response already at our pin.
- `enums/task-status.json`: `submitted | working | input-required | completed |
  canceled | failed | rejected | auth-required | unknown`.
- `media-buy/{create,update}-media-buy-response.json` success branch (`*Success`)
  carries `status: $ref media-buy-status.json` — i.e. a **MediaBuyStatus**
  (`pending_creatives | pending_start | active | paused | completed | …`). There
  is **no `media_buy_status` field** at this commit. The async/submitted branch's
  `status` is the TaskStatus discriminator.

**Decision:**
1. `the response status should be "completed"` asserts the **envelope
   `TaskStatus`** (REQUIRED protocol-layer field), value `completed` for a
   synchronous success. `completed` is also a *MediaBuyStatus* value, but it
   means "flight over" — impossible for a just-updated active buy — so the
   scenario can only mean the TaskStatus.
2. The harness must observe responses **with their envelope**. On the wire
   transports the envelope `status` is part of the response (MCP: sibling of
   payload at root; A2A: in the artifact DataPart; REST: JSON body root). The
   `then_response_status` step asserts the envelope `status`, not a probed
   domain `model_fields["status"]`.

**Known collision at `04f59d2d5` (do NOT "fix" by adopting newer schema).** Because
the success body still carries `status: MediaBuyStatus` while the envelope
carries `status: TaskStatus`, the two collide on the root `status` key under MCP
flat-on-the-wire serialization. Upstream resolves this *after* our pin
(changeset `4895`, beta.2/.3: add `media_buy_status`, deprecate the body
`status`, remove in 3.2). Per the source-of-truth hierarchy we reconcile this
**upstream at the next derivation bump**, not by editing local generated
features or unilaterally adding `media_buy_status` against a 04f59d2d5-derived
suite. Tracked as a reconciliation note, not an immediate production change.

**Ref hazard (learned here).** `04f59d2d5` is an *ancestor* of every `v3.1.0-beta.*`
tag (226 commits behind beta.3). Reading a beta tag surfaces changes
(`envelope-status-required` formalization, `media_buy_status`) and forward 3.2
notes that are **not** in our derivation. Always `git show 04f59d2d5:<path>` for
BR-feature semantics. Note the separate divergence: the Python SDK `adcp==5.7`
targets `3.1.0-beta.3`, so runtime types may differ from the 04f59d2d5 features —
this is the "SDK is not authoritative; scenario drives" case.

**Consequence — this reframes the harness problem (see D4).** `_impl` returns
only the payload; it has **no envelope**, so by the spec's own words it is a
non-conformant response. A status assertion can never be satisfied on a raw
`_impl` call — not because the harness is wrong, but because `_impl` is not an
AdCP response surface.

### D4 — `_impl` is not an AdCP response surface; BDD conformance runs on the wire transports (PROPOSED)

**Problem (raised in review).** The BDD harness parametrizes every scenario over
four transports including `impl`, which calls `_impl` directly. But `_impl`
deliberately implements **only** transport-agnostic business logic. Everything
the wire contract requires is added at the boundary, *above* `_impl`:

| Boundary behavior | Lives in | `_impl` has it? |
|-------------------|----------|------------------|
| Envelope `status` (TaskStatus, REQUIRED — D2) | `ProtocolEnvelope` / transport wrappers | No |
| Two-layer error envelope (`adcp_error`, error code, recovery) | wrappers (`_handle_tool_exception`, `build_two_layer_error_envelope`) | No (raises `AdCPError`) |
| Account resolution → `ACCOUNT_NOT_FOUND` | `enrich_identity_with_account` in wrappers (`media_buy_create.py:3927/4004`) | No |
| Identity/auth resolution, `context_id`, `replayed`/idempotency | wrappers / middleware | No |

A large fraction of UC scenarios assert exactly these boundary behaviors. On
`impl` they are **unsatisfiable by construction**, which is the real reason the
UC-002 account-not-found and UC-003 success/status families could not go green
on `impl`. `impl`'s only legitimate BDD value is the narrow set of purely
transport-agnostic business-logic outcomes — which are better covered by unit /
integration tests that call the harness or `_impl` directly.

**Proposed decision.** Treat AdCP conformance as a **wire** property and run BDD
scenarios on the wire transports (`mcp`, `a2a`, `rest`). Remove `impl` from the
**default** BDD transport parametrization. Keep transport-agnostic business-logic
coverage in unit/integration tests (harness `call_impl` is still available
there). This (a) aligns the BDD suite with the spec's definition of conformance,
(b) deletes an entire class of by-construction-impossible `impl` failures
(unblocking the `l9wn`/`egnl`/parser families without per-`impl` workarounds),
and (c) cuts ~25% of BDD test instances.

**Alternatives considered:**
- *Redefine `impl` as in-process-through-boundary* — run identity-resolve →
  account-enrich → `_impl` → envelope-build in-process (no HTTP), so `impl`
  becomes a fast, conformant transport. Preserves a fast path and matches the
  "harness → true E2E" direction, but `impl` then largely duplicates `mcp`/`a2a`
  minus serialization, for marginal extra value over running the three wire
  transports.
- *Scope `impl`* — keep `impl` only for scenarios explicitly tagged
  transport-agnostic; exclude it from boundary/conformance scenarios. Lowest
  blast radius but adds a per-scenario tagging burden and leaves the conceptual
  confusion ("why does this scenario skip impl?") in place.

**Open / gating before adopting:** audit which scenarios currently pass
**only** on `impl` (e.g. `MediaBuyAccountEnv` is `impl`-only today) so their
coverage is preserved on the wire transports or re-homed to unit tests before
`impl` is dropped. Owner decision required — see report.

Do **not** hack `then_response_status` to probe `model_fields` for branching
(memory `feedback_sdk_not_authoritative`: the SDK/model is not authoritative for
shape decisions).

### D3 — Account resolution belongs at the boundary, mirrored by the harness (DECIDED-direction)

Account resolution stays at the transport boundary (it is identity-shaping,
not business logic — consistent with the transport-boundary architecture in
`CLAUDE.md` Pattern #5). The harness, not `_impl`, must mirror it. This means
the create envs gain per-transport account enrichment rather than pushing
resolution into `_create_media_buy_impl`.
