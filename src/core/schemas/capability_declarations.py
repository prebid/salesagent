"""Per-tenant AdCP capability declarations (#1592 T1a).

The store behind ``tenants.capability_declarations``: the blocks an operator may
declare and have echoed on ``get_adcp_capabilities``.

STRICT policy (KonstantinMirin's decision, 2026-07-27). A capability posture may be
declared -- and therefore emitted -- ONLY when the implementation backs it. So this
model carries fields for *business facts* the response merely echoes, and has NO
field at all for a *behavioral posture* production does not implement. Naming an
unbacked block is a deployment fault, not a buyer error: it raises
``AdCPConfigurationError`` -> ``CONFIGURATION_ERROR`` (recovery ``terminal``),
naming the block and the issue that will implement it.

Why "no field" rather than "a field we validate": a field that exists but is always
rejected still tempts the next implementer to relax the check. The absence is the
enforcement.

Shape follows ``IdempotencyPosture`` (src/core/idempotency_policy.py): a typed
model whose ``validate_backing()`` raises ``AdCPConfigurationError`` rather than
silently clamping or emitting a non-conformant response.
