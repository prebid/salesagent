        error: Exception raised during dispatch, if any.
        raw_response: Unprocessed transport response (httpx.Response, ToolResult, etc.).
        wire_response: Serialized success-path response body as a dict, captured
            from the real wire (REST HTTP JSON body, MCP structured_content, A2A
            artifact DataPart). ``None`` on error and on IMPL (no wire — serialize
            the typed ``payload`` instead). Lets success-path tests assert the
            actual serialized shape (e.g. the v3.1 format_id federation contract).
        wire_error_envelope: Raw two-layer error envelope dict captured from
            the actual wire bytes (REST HTTP body, MCP ToolError content text,
            A2A failed-Task artifact DataPart). ``None`` on success or on the
            IMPL transport, which has no wire. This is the canonical field
            for error verification — see ``tests/CLAUDE.md`` § Error
            Verification Policy.
        synthesized_error_envelope: Two-layer envelope produced by
            ``build_two_layer_error_envelope`` against the IMPL-caught
            ``AdCPError`` — what production WOULD emit at the boundary.
            ``None`` on success and on REST/MCP/A2A (those expose the real
            wire envelope above instead). Tests asserting on this field
            verify the envelope-builder contract, NOT the wire shape — a
            regression in the production boundary translator would not be
            caught here. Use REST/MCP/A2A for wire-shape regressions.
        wire_error_envelope_synthesized: ``True`` when the A2A dispatcher could
            not find real wire bytes and REBUILT ``wire_error_envelope`` from the
            reconstructed exception. That happens for an ``A2AError`` raised with
            no ``data``: the buyer receives a bare protocol error carrying no
            AdCP envelope, yet ``wire_error_envelope`` is populated anyway, so a
            wire assertion can pass against an envelope nobody was ever sent.
            Always ``False`` on REST/MCP (they read real bytes) and on success.
            Pass ``require_real_wire=True`` to ``assert_wire_error`` to refuse
