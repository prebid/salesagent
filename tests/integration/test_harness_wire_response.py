"""Authenticity guard for TransportResult.wire_response.

The UC-005 format_id federation-contract scenario asserts the ``{agent_url, id}``
object shape on ``wire_response`` for REST/A2A/MCP. That is only meaningful if
``wire_response`` carries the *real* serialized bytes rather than a re-serialization
of the already-validated typed payload — otherwise the wire assertions would be
tautological again (the typed payload can never be a bare string by construction).

These tests pin that contract against ``list_creative_formats`` so a future refactor
cannot quietly substitute a reconstruction. IMPL has no wire by definition.

MCP has no envelope-only markers (GH #1710): before that fix, the MCP wrapper
handed ``ToolResult`` the raw pydantic response object, which
FastMCP serializes via ``pydantic_core.to_jsonable_python()`` — bypassing
``AdCPBaseModel``'s ``exclude_none=True`` default, so unset optional fields
(``task_id``, ``adcp_version``) leaked onto the wire as ``null``. Those leaked
nulls were incidentally usable as "this must be real wire, not a reconstruction"
markers. The fix makes the MCP wrapper pass ``response.model_dump(mode="json")``
instead — the *same* call A2A/REST already use — so MCP's ``structured_content``
is now BYTE-IDENTICAL to a plain payload dump: there is no separate MCP envelope
layer, by design (FastMCP's ``structured_content`` IS the tool's typed output).
So the MCP authenticity check below asserts round-trip fidelity (a fabricated or
partial dict wouldn't parse back into the response type and re-dump identically)
rather than envelope-only-key presence.
