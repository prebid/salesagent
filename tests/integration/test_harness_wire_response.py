"""Authenticity guard for TransportResult.wire_response.

The UC-005 format_id federation-contract scenario asserts the ``{agent_url, id}``
object shape on ``wire_response`` for REST/A2A/MCP. That is only meaningful if
``wire_response`` carries the *real* serialized bytes rather than a re-serialization
of the already-validated typed payload — otherwise the wire assertions would be
tautological again (the typed payload can never be a bare string by construction).

These tests pin that contract against ``list_creative_formats`` so a future refactor
cannot quietly substitute a reconstruction. IMPL has no wire by definition.
