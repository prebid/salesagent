"""Regression tests for GH #1802.

The BDD step tier translates a Gherkin auth scheme into the
``PushNotificationConfig`` auth columns. Two obligations, at two different loci:

``_auth_scheme_to_db_fields`` (per-call, during incremental Given setup):
  1. no scheme named                -> ``{}``
  2. canonical scheme + credential  -> both columns
  3. NOT a pinned AuthenticationScheme member -> raises ValueError

``_wire_webhook_db`` (end-state, at dispatch, after every Given has run):
  4. a scheme was named but no credential ever arrived -> raises AssertionError

Outcomes 3 and 4 are the bug: both used to return the SAME empty dict that
outcome 1 legitimately returns, so the caller persisted a row with no
authentication columns. A scenario whose Gherkin claims signing then graded an
unauthenticated config and passed, because unsigned delivery succeeds -- green
while measuring nothing.

Why 4 is graded at dispatch and not per-call: scenarios name the scheme on one
line and supply the credential on the next (BR-UC-004:252-253, :264-265), and
``given_webhook_auth_scheme`` persists the row on the first line. A missing
credential mid-setup is legitimate; only at dispatch is it a defect.

The canonical set is never spelled locally -- it comes from the SDK's pinned
``AuthenticationScheme``, whose members' values ARE the spec spellings.
